<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)>Splitting (psychology)</a> </h2>
<p>Splitting (also called black-and-white thinking or all-or-nothing thinking) is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the dichotomy of both perceived positive and negative qualities of something into a cohesive, realistic whole. 　It is a common defense mechanism wherein the individual tends to think in extremes (e.g., an individual's actions and motivations are all good or all bad with no middle ground). 　This kind of dichotomous interpretation is contrasted by an acknowledgement of certain nuances known as "shades of gray". 　Splitting was first described by Ronald Fairbairn in his formulation of object relations theory; it begins as the inability of the infant to combine the fulfilling aspects of the parents (the good object) and their unresponsive aspects (the unsatisfying object) into the same individuals, instead seeing the good and bad as separate. 　In psychoanalytic theory this functions as a defense mechanism.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor>Sensor</a> </h2>
<p>A sensor is a device that produces an output signal for the purpose of sensing a physical phenomenon. 　In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. 　Sensors are always used with other electronics. 　Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, and in innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. 　With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure and flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors. 　Analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used. 　Their applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life. 　There is a wide range of other sensors that measure chemical and physical properties of materials, including optical sensors for refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement, and electro-chemical sensors for monitoring pH of fluids. 　A sensor's sensitivity indicates how much its output changes when the input quantity it measures changes. 　For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, its sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope dy/dx assuming a linear characteristic). 　Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. 　Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages. 　Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. 　In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches. 　Due to the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors—low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements—have recently gained growing importance. 　Using this class of sensors, critical analytical information can be obtained by anyone, anywhere and at any time, without the need for recalibration and worrying about contamination.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety>Anxiety</a> </h2>
<p>Anxiety is an emotion which is characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events. 　Anxiety is different than fear in that the former is defined as the anticipation of a future threat whereas the latter is defined as the emotional response to a real threat. 　It is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. 　Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. 　It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue, inability to catch one's breath, tightness in the abdominal region, nausea, and problems in concentration. 　Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat (fight or flight response); anxiety involves the expectation of future threat including dread. 　People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. 　The emotion of anxiety can persist beyond the developmentally appropriate time-periods in response to specific events, and thus turning into one of the multiple anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder). 　The difference between anxiety disorder (as mental disorder) and anxiety (as normal emotion), is that people with an anxiety disorder experience anxiety most of the days during approximately 6 months, or even during shorter time-periods in children. 　Anxiety disorders are among the most persistent mental problems and often last decades. 　Besides, strong percepts of anxiety exist within other mental disorders, e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_(pathology)>Corn (pathology)</a> </h2>
<p>A corn or clavus (plural clavi or clavuses) is a cone-shaped and often painful inwardly directed callus of dead skin that forms at a pressure point near a bone, or on a weight-bearing part of the body. 　When on the feet, corns can be so painful as to interfere with walking. 　The visible portion of the corn tends to be more-or-less round, but corns are defined by having a hard tapering root that is directed inward, and pressure on the corn pushes this root deeper into the flesh. 　(Thus the Latin term clavus 'nail'.) 　Pressure corns usually occur on thin or glabrous (hairless and smooth) skin surfaces, especially on the dorsal surface of toes or fingers, but corns triggered by an acute injury (such as a thorn) may occur on the thicker skin of the palms or bottom of the feet (palmar corns and plantar corns). 　Pressure corns form when chronic pressure on the skin against an underlying bone traces a usually elliptical path during the rubbing motion. 　The corn forms at the center of the pressure point and gradually widens and deepens. 　Corns from an acute injury, such as a from a thorn in the sole of the foot, may form due to the weight of the body, when the process that creates the usually evenly developing plantar callus is concentrated at the point of the healing injury, as an internal callus may be triggered by pressure on the transitional scar tissue. 　Once formed, the corn itself becomes the pressure point that generates the callus. 　Plantar corns are superficially similar to plantar warts, but the cause and treatment are very different.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn>Corn</a> </h2>
<p>Corn is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. 　The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences (or "tassels") and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that when fertilized yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits. 　The term corn is preferred in formal, scientific, and international usage as a common name because it refers specifically to this one grain, unlike maize, which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region. 　Corn has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of corn surpassing that of wheat or rice. 　In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa), corn is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other corn products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. 　The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. 　Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into cornmeal or masa, pressing into corn oil, fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey), and as feedstocks for the chemical industry. 　Corn is also used in making ethanol and other biofuels. 　Corn is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of corn is produced each year than any other grain. 　In 2021, total world production was 1.2 billion tonnes. 　Corn is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas, with 384 million metric tons grown in the United States alone in 2021.[citation needed] Genetically modified corn made up 85% of the corn planted in the United States in 2009. 　Subsidies in the United States help to account for its high level of cultivation of corn and its position as the largest producer in the world.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grief>Grief</a> </h2>
<p>Grief is the response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or some living thing that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. 　Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, grief also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. 　While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, while grief is the reaction to that loss. 　The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. 　Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract; physical loss is related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are more abstract, possibly relating to aspects of a person's social interactions.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent>Continent</a> </h2>
<p>A continent is any of several large geographical regions. 　Continents are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, it could be a single landmass or a part of a very large landmass, as in the case of Asia or Europe. 　Due to this, the number of continents varies; up to seven or as few as four geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. 　Most English-speaking countries recognize seven regions as continents. 　In order from largest to smallest in area, these seven regions are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. 　Different variations with fewer continents merge some of these regions, examples of this are merging North America and South America into America, Asia and Europe into Eurasia, and Africa, Asia, and Europe into Afro-Eurasia. 　Oceanic islands are frequently grouped with a nearby continent to divide all the world's land into geographical regions. 　Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form the geographical region Oceania. 　In geology, a continent is defined as "one of Earth's major landmasses, including both dry land and continental shelves". 　The geological continents correspond to seven large areas of continental crust that are found on the tectonic plates, but exclude small continental fragments such as Madagascar that are generally referred to as microcontinents. 　Continental crust is only known to exist on Earth. 　The idea of continental drift gained recognition in the 20th century. 　It postulates that the current continents formed from the breaking up of a supercontinent (Pangaea) that formed hundreds of millions of years ago.</p>

<p>Battles of Napoleon Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French military commander and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. 　He was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. 　Napoleon's political and cultural legacy endures to this day, as a highly celebrated and controversial leader. 　He initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted in society, and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. 　His wars and campaigns are studied by militaries all over the world. 　Between three and six million civilians and soldiers perished in what became known as the Napoleonic Wars. 　Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica, not long after its annexation by France, to a native family descending from minor Italian nobility. 　He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. 　He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. 　In 1796, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero. 　Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. 　He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. 　Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. 　Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign, and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. 　In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. 　Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. 　Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram. 　Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. 　The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. 　Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. 　The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Armée. 　In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. 　The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. 　He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. 　In France, the Bourbons were restored to power. 　Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France. 　The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. 　The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51. 　Napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the lands he conquered, especially the regions of the Low Countries, Switzerland and parts of modern Italy and Germany. 　He implemented many liberal policies in France and Western Europe.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection>Inspection</a> </h2>
<p>An inspection is, most generally, an organized examination or formal evaluation exercise. 　In engineering activities inspection involves the measurements, tests, and gauges applied to certain characteristics in regard to an object or activity. 　The results are usually compared to specified requirements and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets, often with a Standard Inspection Procedure in place to ensure consistent checking. 　Inspections are usually non-destructive. 　Inspections may be a visual inspection or involve sensing technologies such as ultrasonic testing, accomplished with a direct physical presence or remotely such as a remote visual inspection, and manually or automatically such as an automated optical inspection. 　Non-contact optical measurement and photogrammetry have become common NDT methods for inspection of manufactured components and design optimisation. 　A 2007 Scottish Government review of scrutiny of public services (the Crerar Review) defined inspection of public services as "... periodic, targeted scrutiny of specific services, to check whether they are meeting national and local performance standards, legislative and professional requirements, and the needs of service users." 　A surprise inspection tends to have different results than an announced inspection. 　Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what happens. 　If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes. 　This could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. 　A surprise inspection, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection. 　It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process.　: 28</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon>Cannon</a> </h2>
<p>A cannon is a large-caliber gun classified as a type of artillery, which usually launches a projectile using explosive chemical propellant. 　Gunpowder ("black powder") was the primary propellant before the invention of smokeless powder during the late 19th century. 　Cannons vary in gauge, effective range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. 　A cannon is a type of heavy artillery weapon. 　The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed. 　In the modern era, the term cannon has fallen into decline, replaced by guns or artillery, if not a more specific term such as howitzer or mortar, except for high-caliber automatic weapons firing bigger rounds than machine guns, called autocannons. 　The earliest known depiction of cannons appeared in Song dynasty China as early as the 12th century; however, solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannons do not appear until the 13th century. 　In 1288 Yuan dynasty troops are recorded to have used hand cannon in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from the same period. 　By the early 14th century, possible mentions of cannon had appeared in the Middle East and the depiction of one in Europe by 1326. 　Recorded usage of cannon began appearing almost immediately after. 　They subsequently spread to India, their usage on the subcontinent being first attested to in 1366. 　By the end of the 14th century, cannons were widespread throughout Eurasia. 　Cannons were used primarily as anti-infantry weapons until around 1374, when large cannons were recorded to have breached walls for the first time in Europe. 　Cannons featured prominently as siege weapons, and ever larger pieces appeared. 　In 1464 a 16,000 kg (35,000 lb) cannon known as the Great Turkish Bombard was created in the Ottoman Empire. 　Cannons as field artillery became more important after 1453, with the introduction of limber, which greatly improved cannon maneuverability and mobility. 　European cannons reached their longer, lighter, more accurate, and more efficient "classic form" around 1480. 　This classic European cannon design stayed relatively consistent in form with minor changes until the 1750s.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone>Limestone</a> </h2>
<p>Limestone (calcium carbonate CaCO3) is a type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime. 　It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of CaCO3. 　Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. 　This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes, though biological processes, such as the accumulation of corals and shells in the sea, have likely been more important for the last 540 million years. 　Limestone often contains fossils which provide scientists with information on ancient environments and on the evolution of life. 　About 20% to 25% of sedimentary rock is carbonate rock, and most of this is limestone. 　The remaining carbonate rock is mostly dolomite, a closely related rock, which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2. 　Magnesian limestone is an obsolete and poorly-defined term used variously for dolomite, for limestone containing significant dolomite (dolomitic limestone), or for any other limestone containing a significant percentage of magnesium. 　Most limestone was formed in shallow marine environments, such as continental shelves or platforms, though smaller amounts were formed in many other environments. 　Much dolomite is secondary dolomite, formed by chemical alteration of limestone. 　Limestone is exposed over large regions of the Earth's surface, and because limestone is slightly soluble in rainwater, these exposures often are eroded to become karst landscapes. 　Most cave systems are found in limestone bedrock. 　Limestone has numerous uses: as a chemical feedstock for the production of lime used for cement (an essential component of concrete), as aggregate for the base of roads, as white pigment or filler in products such as toothpaste or paints, as a soil conditioner, and as a popular decorative addition to rock gardens. 　Limestone formations contain about 30% of the world's petroleum reservoirs.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony>Harmony</a> </h2>
<p>In music, harmony is the process by which individual sounds are joined together or composed into whole units or compositions. 　Often, the term harmony refers to simultaneously occurring frequencies, pitches (tones, notes), or chords. 　However, harmony is generally understood to involve both vertical harmony (chords) and horizontal harmony (melody). 　Harmony is a perceptual property of music, and, along with melody, one of the building blocks of Western music. 　Its perception is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times throughout Western music. 　In a physiological approach, consonance is a continuous variable. 　Consonant pitch relationships are described as sounding more pleasant, euphonious, and beautiful than dissonant relationships which sound unpleasant, discordant, or rough. 　The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. 　Counterpoint, which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are therefore sometimes distinguished from harmony. 　In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. 　In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". 　A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. 　Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. 　Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between consonance and dissonance. 　Simply put, this occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. 　Dissonance is an important part of harmony when dissonance can be resolved and contribute to the composition of music as a whole. 　A misplayed note or any sound that is judged to detract from the whole composition can be described as disharmonious rather than dissonant.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol>Pistol</a> </h2>
<p>A pistol is a handgun, more specifically one with the chamber integral to its gun barrel, though in common usage the two terms are often used interchangeably. 　The English word was introduced in c. 　1570, when early handguns were produced in Europe, and is derived from the Middle French pistolet (c. 1550), meaning a small gun or knife. 　In colloquial usage, the word "pistol" is often used to describe any type of handgun, inclusive of revolvers (which have a single barrel and a separate cylinder housing multiple chambers) and the pocket-sized derringers (which are often multi-barrelled). 　The most common type of pistol used in the contemporary era is the semi-automatic pistol, while the older single-shot and manual repeating pistols are now rarely seen and used primarily for nostalgic hunting and historical reenactment, and the fully automatic machine pistols are uncommon in civilian usage due to generally poor recoil-controllability and strict laws and regulations governing their manufacture and sale.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative>Derivative</a> </h2>
<p>In mathematics, the derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). 　Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. 　For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances. 　The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. 　The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. 　For this reason, the derivative is often described as the "instantaneous rate of change", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. 　Derivatives can be generalized to functions of several real variables. 　In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. 　The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. 　It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables. 　For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector. 　The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. 　The reverse process is called antidifferentiation. 　The fundamental theorem of calculus relates antidifferentiation with integration. 　Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.</p>
