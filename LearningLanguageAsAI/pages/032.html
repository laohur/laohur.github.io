<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof>Roof</a> </h2>
<p>A roof (PL: roofs or rooves) is the top covering of a building, including all materials and constructions necessary to support it on the walls of the building or on uprights, providing protection against rain, snow, sunlight, extremes of temperature, and wind. 　A roof is part of the building envelope. 　The characteristics of a roof are dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers, the available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction and wider concepts of architectural design and practice, and may also be governed by local or national legislation. 　In most countries, a roof protects primarily against rain. 　A verandah may be roofed with material that protects against sunlight but admits the other elements. 　The roof of a garden conservatory protects plants from cold, wind, and rain, but admits light. 　A roof may also provide additional living space, for example, a roof garden.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier>Premier</a> </h2>
<p>Premier is a title for the head of government in central governments, state governments and local governments of some countries. 　A second in command to a premier is designated as a deputy premier. 　A premier will normally be a head of government, but is not the head of state. 　In presidential systems, the two roles are often combined into one, whereas in parliamentary systems of government the two are usually kept separate.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon>Moon</a> </h2>
<p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. 　It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet, with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia). 　The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System. 　It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. 　Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density. 　The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter. 　Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day. 　The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. 　During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. 　The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. 　However, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as libration. 　The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. 　It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. 　The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. 　Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. 　The lunar surface is fairly non-reflective, with the reflectance of lunar soil being comparable to that of asphalt. 　However, due to its large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. 　The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. 　Both the Moon's prominence in Earth's sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural references and influences for human societies throughout history. 　Such influences can be found in language, calendar systems, art, and mythology. 　The first artificial object to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966. 　The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972. 　These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins, internal structure, and subsequent history. 　As of 2023, the Moon is the only other celestial body visited by humans, other than the Earth.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron>Electron</a> </h2>
<p>The electron ( e− or β− ) is a subatomic particle with a negative one elementary electric charge. 　Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. 　The electron's mass is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. 　Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. 　Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. 　Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: They can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. 　The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de Broglie wavelength for a given energy. 　Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. 　Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to generate a magnetic field. 　Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. 　Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. 　Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. 　Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. 　Electrons are involved in many applications such as tribology or frictional charging, electrolysis, electrochemistry, battery technologies, electronics, welding, cathode-ray tubes, photoelectricity, photovoltaic solar panels, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators. 　Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. 　The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as atoms. 　Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system. 　The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding. 　In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms. 　Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 during the cathode-ray tube experiment. 　Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles. 　Electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. 　The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical charge of the opposite sign. 　When an electron collides with a positron, both particles can be annihilated, producing gamma ray photons.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy>Economy</a> </h2>
<p>An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services. 　In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of scarce resources. 　A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources as main factors. 　These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. 　In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone. 　Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. 　Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. 　However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. 　Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. 　It has changed over time due to technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition>Tradition</a> </h2>
<p>A tradition is a belief or behavior (folk custom) passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. 　A component of cultural expressions and folklore, common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. 　Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word tradition itself derives from the Latin tradere literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. 　While it is commonly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. 　Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. 　The phrase "according to tradition", or "by tradition", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. 　Tradition is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. 　For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." 　This tradition may never be proven or disproven. 　In another example, "King Arthur, by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories." 　Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.　[citation needed] Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in social sciences such as folklore studies, anthropology, archaeology, and biology. 　The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. 　For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism. 　In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. 　For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. 　A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. 　In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. 　Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury>Injury</a> </h2>
<p>An injury is any physiological damage to living tissue caused by immediate physical stress. 　An injury can occur intentionally or unintentionally and may be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burning, toxic exposure, asphyxiation, or overexertion. 　Injuries can occur in any part of the body, and different symptoms are associated with different injuries. 　Treatment of a major injury is typically carried out by a health professional and varies greatly depending on the nature of the injury. 　Traffic collisions are the most common cause of accidental injury and injury-related death among humans. 　Injuries are distinct from chronic conditions, psychological trauma, infections, or medical procedures, though injury can be a contributing factor to any of these. 　Several major health organizations have established systems for the classification and description of human injuries.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade>Brigade</a> </h2>
<p>A brigade is a major tactical military formation that typically comprises three to six battalions plus supporting elements. 　It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. 　Two or more brigades may constitute a division. 　Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades). 　In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units. 　Historically, such brigades have sometimes been called brigade-groups. 　On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task. 　Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic. 　Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure. 　The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 5,000 troops. 　However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could start as high as 10,000 troops. 　The Soviet Union, its forerunners and successors, mostly use "regiment" instead of brigade, and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II. 　A brigade's commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel. 　In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer. 　The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff. 　The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff. 　Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position 'brigade-major’ and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff. 　Some brigades may also have a deputy commander. 　The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade. 　On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached. 　The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit. 　In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit.</p>

<p>A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. 　In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. 　Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. 　Traditionally warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. 　Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history. 　In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. 　Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer, wine and cocktails, but are made with a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume. 　The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport>Sport</a> </h2>
<p>Sport pertains to any form of physical activity or game, often competitive and/or organized, that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. 　Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve participants' physical health. 　Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. 　In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. 　Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. 　A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. 　Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. 　Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition. 　Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports. 　However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. 　The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports. 　Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. 　Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. 　It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression. 　Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. 　Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. 　Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport. 　According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. 　The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.</p>

<p>In artificial intelligence and cognitive science, the term situated refers to an agent which is embedded in an environment. 　The term situated is commonly used to refer to robots, but some researchers argue that software agents can also be situated if: they exist in a dynamic (rapidly changing) environment, which they can manipulate or change through their actions, and which they can sense or perceive. 　Examples might include web-based agents, which can alter data or trigger processes (such as purchases) over the internet, or virtual-reality bots which inhabit and change virtual worlds, such as Second Life. 　Being situated is generally considered to be part of being embodied, but it is useful to consider each perspective individually. 　The situated perspective emphasizes that intelligent behaviour derives from the environment and the agent's interactions with it. 　The nature of these interactions are defined by an agent's embodiment.</p>

<p>Colonel (abbreviated as Col., Col or COL) is a senior military officer rank used in many countries. 　It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. 　In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, a colonel was typically in charge of a regiment in an army. 　Modern usage varies greatly, and in some cases, the term is used as an honorific title that may have no direct relationship to military service. 　The rank of colonel is typically above the rank of lieutenant colonel. 　The rank above colonel is typically called brigadier, brigade general or brigadier general. 　In some smaller military forces, such as those of Monaco or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. 　Equivalent naval ranks may be called captain or ship-of-the-line captain. 　In the Commonwealth's air force ranking system, the equivalent rank is group captain.</p>
