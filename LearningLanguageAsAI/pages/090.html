<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume>Costume</a> </h2>
<p>Costume is the distinctive style of dress or cosmetic of an individual or group that reflects class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. 　In short costume is a cultural visual of the people. 　The term also was traditionally used to describe typical appropriate clothing for certain activities, such as riding costume, swimming costume, dance costume, and evening costume. 　Appropriate and acceptable costume is subject to changes in fashion and local cultural norms. 　"But sable is worn more in carriages, lined with real lace over ivory satin, and worn over some smart costume suitable for an afternoon reception." 　A Woman's Letter from London (23 November 1899). 　This general usage has gradually been replaced by the terms "dress", "attire", "robes" or "wear" and usage of "costume" has become more limited to unusual or out-of-date clothing and to attire intended to evoke a change in identity, such as theatrical, Halloween, and mascot costumes. 　Before the advent of ready-to-wear apparel, clothing was made by hand. 　When made for commercial sale it was made, as late as the beginning of the 20th century, by "costumiers", often women who ran businesses that met the demand for complicated or intimate female costume, including millinery and corsetry.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation>Inflation</a> </h2>
<p>In economics, inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy. 　When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. 　The opposite of inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. 　The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index. 　As prices faced by households do not all increase at the same rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is often used for this purpose. 　The employment cost index is also used for wages in the United States. 　Most economists agree that high levels of inflation as well as hyperinflation—which have severely disruptive effects on the real economy—are caused by persistent excessive growth in the money supply. 　Views on low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied. 　Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services, or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities. 　Moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. 　The negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. 　Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation. 　Today, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. 　Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the probability of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy, while avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. 　The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. 　Generally, these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, by carrying out open market operations and (more rarely) changing commercial bank reserve requirements.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)>Inflation (cosmology)</a> </h2>
<p>In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe. 　The inflationary epoch is believed to have lasted from 10−36 seconds after the conjectured Big Bang singularity to some time between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds after the singularity. 　Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. 　The acceleration of this expansion due to dark energy began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago). 　Inflation theory was developed in the late 1970s and early 80s, with notable contributions by several theoretical physicists, including Alexei Starobinsky at Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Alan Guth at Cornell University, and Andrei Linde at Lebedev Physical Institute. 　Alexei Starobinsky, Alan Guth, and Andrei Linde won the 2014 Kavli Prize "for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation". 　It was developed further in the early 1980s. 　It explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. 　Quantum fluctuations in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the Universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation). 　Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed. 　The detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown. 　The basic inflationary paradigm is accepted by most physicists, as a number of inflation model predictions have been confirmed by observation; however, a substantial minority of scientists dissent from this position. 　The hypothetical field thought to be responsible for inflation is called the inflaton. 　In 2002 three of the original architects of the theory were recognized for their major contributions; physicists Alan Guth of M.I.T., Andrei Linde of Stanford, and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton shared the prestigious Dirac Prize "for development of the concept of inflation in cosmology". 　In 2012 Guth and Linde were awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their invention and development of inflationary cosmology.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration>Acceleration</a> </h2>
<p>In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time. 　Accelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). 　The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object. 　The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's Second Law, is the combined effect of two causes: the net balance of all external forces acting onto that object — magnitude is directly proportional to this net resulting force; that object's mass, depending on the materials out of which it is made — magnitude is inversely proportional to the object's mass. 　The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m⋅s−2, m s 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {\tfrac {m}{s^{2}}} } ). 　For example, when a vehicle starts from a standstill (zero velocity, in an inertial frame of reference) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. 　If the vehicle turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new direction and changes its motion vector. 　The acceleration of the vehicle in its current direction of motion is called a linear (or tangential during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers on board experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. 　When changing direction, the effecting acceleration is called radial (or centripetal during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers experience as a centrifugal force. 　If the speed of the vehicle decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction and mathematically a negative, sometimes called deceleration or retardation, and passengers experience the reaction to deceleration as an inertial force pushing them forward. 　Such negative accelerations are often achieved by retrorocket burning in spacecraft. 　Both acceleration and deceleration are treated the same, as they are both changes in velocity. 　Each of these accelerations (tangential, radial, deceleration) is felt by passengers until their relative (differential) velocity are neutralized in reference to the acceleration due to change in speed.</p>

<p>Sovereign is a title that can be applied to the highest leader in various categories. 　The word is borrowed from Old French souverain, which is ultimately derived from the Latin superānus, meaning 'above'. 　The roles of a sovereign vary from monarch, ruler or head of state to head of municipal government or head of a chivalric order. 　As a result, the word sovereignty has more recently also come to mean independence or autonomy.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme>Enzyme</a> </h2>
<p>Enzymes (/ˈɛnzaɪmz/) are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. 　The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. 　Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.　: 8.1  Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. 　The study of enzymes is called enzymology and the field of pseudoenzyme analysis recognizes that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties. 　Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. 　Other biocatalysts are catalytic RNA molecules, called ribozymes. 　Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures. 　Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. 　Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. 　An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. 　Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. 　Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. 　Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. 　Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. 　An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH, and many enzymes are (permanently) denatured when exposed to excessive heat, losing their structure and catalytic properties. 　Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. 　Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat stains on clothes, and enzymes in meat tenderizer break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.</p>

<p>A neighbourhood (British English, Irish English, Australian English and Canadian English) or neighborhood (American English; see spelling differences) is a geographically localised community within a larger city, town, suburb or rural area, sometimes consisting of a single street and the buildings lining it. 　Neighbourhoods are often social communities with considerable face-to-face interaction among members. 　Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition, but the following may serve as a starting point: "Neighbourhood is generally defined spatially as a specific geographic area and functionally as a set of social networks. Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial units in which face-to-face social interactions occur—the personal settings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise youth, and maintain effective social control."[clarification needed]</p>

<p>Punjab (/pʌnˈdʒɑːb, -ˈdʒæb, ˈpʌn-/; Gurmukhi: ਪੰਜਾਬ; Shahmukhi: پنجاب; Punjabi: [pənˈdʒaːb] (listen); also romanised as Panjāb or Panj-Āb) is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in South Asia, specifically in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, on the Indus Plain comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. 　Punjab's major cities are Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Sialkot, Chandigarh, Shimla, Jalandhar, Gurugram, and Bahawalpur. 　Punjab grew out of the settlements along the five rivers, which served as an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE, and had numerous migrations by the Indo-Aryan peoples. 　Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's social status being determined by land ownership. 　The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and has been described as the "breadbasket of both India and Pakistan." 　The Punjab is also accredited for the establishment of many major dynasties and empires, for example the Hindu Shahis, accredited for the defeat of the Saffarid dynasty and the Samanid Empire.　[page needed] The Sikh Empire with the defeat of the Kashmiris and the Durrani Empire. 　The Mauryan empire with conquering South Asia. 　The Tomara dynasty and Katoch Dynasty who resisted multiple invasion attempts from the Ghaznavids and Ghorids. 　The Vardhana empire who conquered the Alchon Huns and North India. 　The Punjab is also responsible for the Tughlaq and Sayyid empires which formed two of the Delhi sultanate dynasties. 　The Eastern Punjab republics in Ancient Punjab (Yaudheya, Trigarta, Arjunayanas, Audumbaras) are also accredited for the establishment of the Mauryan empire and the defeat of many foreign forces that entered Punjab, for example the Indo-Greek Kingdom and the Kushan Empire. 　The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term "Punjab" has changed over time. 　In the 16th century Mughal Empire the Punjab was split into the Lahore Subah which consisted of Punjab up to Jallandhar with jammu in its boundaries and the Delhi subah which comprised the area east of Jallandhar up to western UP(visit: Subah). 　In British India, until the Partition of India in 1947, the Punjab Province encompassed the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi, and the Pakistani regions of Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory. 　It bordered the Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa regions to the west, Kashmir to the north, the Hindi Belt to the east, and Rajasthan and Sindh to the south. 　The predominant ethnolinguistic group of the Punjab region are the Punjabi people, who speak the Indo-Aryan Punjabi language. 　Punjabi Muslims are the majority in West Punjab (Pakistan), while Punjabi Sikhs are the majority in East Punjab (India). 　Other religious groups are Christianity, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Ravidassia.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion>Abortion</a> </h2>
<p>Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. 　An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies. 　When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". 　The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. 　The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world. 　Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest. 　When properly done, induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine.　: 1  In the United States, the risk of maternal mortality is 14 times lower after induced abortion than after childbirth. 　Unsafe abortions—those performed by people lacking the necessary skills, or in inadequately resourced settings—are responsible for between 5-13% of maternal deaths, especially in the developing world, though self-managed medication abortions are highly effective and safe. 　Public health data shows that making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. 　Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. 　The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. 　The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device. 　Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. 　When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. 　In contrast, unsafe abortions performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. 　The World Health Organization states that "access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health". 　Around 73 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. 　Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. 　As of 2018[update], 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. 　Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. 　Abortion rates are similar between countries that restrict abortion and countries that broadly allow it, though this is partly because countries which restrict abortion tend to have higher unintended pregnancy rates. 　Historically, abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines, sharp tools, forceful massage, or through other traditional methods. 　Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. 　In some areas, abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, fetal defects, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. 　There is debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. 　Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life, and thus equate abortion with murder. 　Those who support the legality of abortion often argue that it is part of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. 　Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_(geology)>Drift (geology)</a> </h2>
<p>In geology, drift is a name for all sediment (clay, silt, sand, gravel, boulders) transported by a glacier and deposited directly by or from the ice, or by glacial meltwater. 　Drift is often subdivided into (unsorted and) unstratified drift (glacial till) that forms moraines and stratified drift (glaciolacustrine and fluvioglacial sediments) that accumulates as stratified and sorted sediments in the form of outwash plains, eskers, kames, varves, and so forth. 　The term drift clay is a synonym for boulder clay. 　Both are archaic terms for glacial tills with a fine-grained matrix. 　In the United Kingdom, drift is also applied as a general term for all surficial, unconsolidated, rock debris and sediment that is moved from one place to accumulate in another and mapped separately or otherwise diffrerentiated from underlying bedrock. 　In this usage, drift includes a wide variety of deposits, e.g. loess, glacial till, river deposits, colluvium, and so forth, of Quaternary age. 　However, this term is most commonly used to specifically describe glacial deposits.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica>Jamaica</a> </h2>
<p>Jamaica (/dʒəˈmeɪkə/ (listen); Jamaican Patois: Jumieka) is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea. 　Spanning 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi) in area, it is the third largest island — after Cuba and Hispaniola — of the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean. 　Jamaica lies about 145 km (90 mi) south of Cuba, and 191 km (119 mi) west of Hispaniola (the island containing the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic); the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 km (134 mi) to the north-west. 　Originally inhabited by the indigenous Taíno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. 　Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish brought large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. 　The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later Great Britain) conquered it, renaming it Jamaica. 　Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants. 　The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. 　Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations. 　The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962. 　With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean. 　Kingston is the country's capital and largest city. 　The majority of Jamaicans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with significant European, East Asian (primarily Chinese), Indian, Lebanese, and mixed-race minorities. 　Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large Jamaican diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 　The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the Rastafari religion, reggae music (and associated genres such as dub, ska and dancehall), and it is internationally prominent in sports, most notably cricket, sprinting and athletics. 　Jamaica is often considered the world's least populous cultural superpower. 　Jamaica is an upper-middle income country with an economy heavily dependent on tourism; it has an average of 4.3 million tourists a year. 　Jamaica performs favourably in measurements of press freedom and democratic governance. 　It ranked first in the Caribbean on the World Happiness Report for 2021. 　Politically it is a Commonwealth realm, with Charles III as its king. 　His appointed representative in the country is the Governor-General of Jamaica, an office held by Patrick Allen since 2009. 　Andrew Holness has served as Prime Minister of Jamaica since March 2016. 　Jamaica is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with legislative power vested in the bicameral Parliament of Jamaica, consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly elected House of Representatives.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint>Complaint</a> </h2>
<p>In legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: cause of action) that the filing party or parties (the plaintiff(s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the defendant(s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a remedy (either money damages or injunctive relief). 　For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in United States courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. 　Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading. 　In Civil Law, a “complaint” is the first formal action taken to officially begin a lawsuit. 　This written document contains the allegations against the defense, the specific laws violated, the facts that led to the dispute, and any demands made by the plaintiff to restore justice. 　In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. 　Most criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the police power of the state with the goal of seeking criminal sanctions, such as the State (also sometimes called the People) or Crown (in Commonwealth realms). 　In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor criminal charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. 　In most U.S. jurisdictions, the charging instrument presented to and authorized by a grand jury is referred to as an indictment.</p>

'Save') the son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, but Moses called him "Yehoshua" (translated as "Joshua" in English), the name by which he is commonly known in English. 　According to the Bible, he was born in Egypt prior to the Exodus. 　The Hebrew Bible identifies Joshua as one of the twelve spies of Israel sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. 　In Numbers 13:1, and after the death of Moses, he led the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan, and allocated lands to the tribes. 　According to biblical chronology, Joshua lived some time in the Bronze Age. 　According to Joshua 24:29, Joshua died at the age of 110. 　Joshua holds a position of respect among Muslims. 　Muslims also see Joshua as the leader of the faithful following the death of Moses. 　In Islam, it is also believed that Yusha bin Nun (Joshua) was the "attendant" of Moses mentioned in the Quran before Moses meets Khidr. 　Joshua plays a role in Islamic literature, with significant narration in the hadith.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism>Terrorism</a> </h2>
<p>Terrorism, in its broadest sense, is the use of criminal violence to provoke a state of terror or fear, mostly with the intention to achieve political or religious aims. 　The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to intentional violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel). 　The terms "terrorist" and "terrorism" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the 1970s during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Basque conflict, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. 　The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States. 　There are various different definitions of terrorism, with no universal agreement about it. 　Terrorism is a charged term. 　It is often used with the connotation of something that is "morally wrong". 　Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups. 　Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives. 　These include left-wing and right-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. 　Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states. 　State terrorism is that perpetrated by nation states, but is not considered such by the state conducting it, making legality a grey area. 　There is no consensus as to whether terrorism should be regarded as a war crime. 　The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and 2014.</p>
