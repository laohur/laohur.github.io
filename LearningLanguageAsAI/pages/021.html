<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway>Highway</a> </h2>
<p>A highway is any public or private road or other public way on land. 　It is used for major roads, but also includes other public roads and public tracks. 　In some areas of the United States, it is used as an equivalent term to controlled-access highway, or a translation for autobahn, autoroute, etc. 　According to Merriam Webster, the use of the term predates the 12th century. 　According to Etymonline, "high" is in the sense of "main". 　In North American and Australian English, major roads such as controlled-access highways or arterial roads are often state highways (Canada: provincial highways). 　Other roads may be designated "county highways" in the US and Ontario. 　These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway. 　In British English, "highway" is primarily a legal term. 　Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc. 　The term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system, highway code, highway patrol and highwayman.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida>Florida</a> </h2>
<p>Florida is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico; Alabama to the northwest; Georgia to the north; the Bahamas and Atlantic Ocean to the east; and the Straits of Florida and Cuba to the south. 　It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. 　Spanning 65,758 square miles (170,310 km2), Florida ranks 22nd in area among the 50 states, and with a population of over 21 million, it is the third-most populous. 　Florida's largest metro area is the Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, though its single largest city proper is Jacksonville. 　Florida's other large population centers include Tampa Bay, Orlando, Cape Coral, and the state capital of Tallahassee. 　Various Native American groups have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. 　In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida ([la floˈɾiða] for its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish). 　Florida subsequently became the first area in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. 　Florida was repeatedly contested by Spain and Great Britain before being ceded to the U.S. in 1819; it was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845. 　Florida was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the longest and most extensive of the Indian Wars in U.S. history. 　The state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after the Civil War on June 25, 1868. 　Since the mid-20th century, Florida has experienced rapid demographic and economic growth. 　Its economy, with a gross state product (GSP) of $1.0 trillion, is the fourth-largest of any U.S. state and the 16th-largest in the world; the main sectors are tourism, hospitality, agriculture, real estate, and transportation. 　Florida is world-renowned for its beach resorts, amusement parks, warm and sunny climate, and nautical recreation; attractions such as Walt Disney World, the Kennedy Space Center, and Miami Beach draw tens of millions of visitors annually. 　Florida is a popular destination for retirees, seasonal vacationers, and both domestic and international migrants; it hosts nine out of the ten fastest-growing communities in the U.S. 　The state's close proximity to the ocean has shaped its culture, identity, and daily life; its colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in African, European, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian influences. 　Florida has attracted or inspired writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway, and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes, particularly in golf, tennis, auto racing, and water sports. 　Florida was also heavily noted for being a battleground state in American presidential elections, particularly those in 2000, 2016, and 2020. 　About two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. 　It has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, spanning approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), not including its many barrier islands. 　Florida has 4,510 islands that are ten acres (4.0 hectares) or larger in area, the second highest number after Alaska. 　Much of the state is at or near sea level, and is characterized by sedimentary soil. 　Florida is the flattest state in the country, with the lowest high point of any U.S. state, at just 345 feet (105 meters). 　Florida's largest freshwater lake, Lake Okeechobee, is the second-largest located entirely within the contiguous 48 states and often referred to as an inland sea. 　Several beaches in Florida have turquoise and emerald-colored coastal waters. 　Florida's climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. 　It is the only state besides Hawaii to have a tropical climate, and is the only continental state with both a tropical climate (at the lower tip of the peninsula) and a coral reef. 　Consequently, Florida has several unique ecosystems, most notably Everglades National Park, the largest tropical wilderness in the U.S. and among the largest in the Americas. 　Unique wildlife include the American alligator, American crocodile, American flamingo, Roseate spoonbill, Florida panther, bottlenose dolphin, and manatee. 　The Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States, and the third-largest coral barrier reef system in the world after the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef.</p>

<p>A border divides two or more geographical boundaries, imposed either by features such as oceans and terrain, or by political entities such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. 　Political borders can be established through warfare, colonization, or mutual agreements between the political entities that reside in those areas; the creation of these agreements is called boundary delimitation. 　Some borders—such as most states' internal administrative borders, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area—are open and completely unguarded. 　Most external political borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints; adjacent border zones may also be controlled. 　Buffer zones may be set up on borders between belligerent entities to lower the risk of escalation. 　While border refers to the boundary itself, the area around the border is called the frontier.</p>

<p>In biology and medicine, a host is a larger organism that harbours a smaller organism; whether a parasitic, a mutualistic, or a commensalist guest (symbiont). 　The guest is typically provided with nourishment and shelter. 　Examples include animals playing host to parasitic worms (e.g. nematodes), cells harbouring pathogenic (disease-causing) viruses, a bean plant hosting mutualistic (helpful) nitrogen-fixing bacteria. 　More specifically in botany, a host plant supplies food resources to micropredators, which have an evolutionarily stable relationship with their hosts similar to ectoparasitism. 　The host range is the collection of hosts that an organism can use as a partner.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales>Wales</a> </h2>
<p>Wales (Welsh: Cymru [ˈkəm.rɨ] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. 　It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, the Celtic Sea to the south west and the Bristol Channel to the south. 　It had a population in 2021 of 3,107,500 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 (8,023 sq mi). 　Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), its highest summit. 　The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. 　The capital and largest city is Cardiff. 　Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales was formed as a kingdom under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1055. 　Wales is regarded as one of the Celtic nations. 　After over 200 years of war, the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though Owain Glyndŵr led the Welsh Revolt against English rule in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (Welsh: senedd). 　In the 16th century the whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. 　Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. 　Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party. 　Welsh national feeling grew over the century; a nationalist party, Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. 　A governing system of Welsh devolution is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of devolved policy matters. 　At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial one; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. 　Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and the nearby valleys. 　The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population, with Wrexham being the largest northern city. 　The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated. 　Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism. 　Agriculture in Wales is largely livestock based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency. 　The country has a distinct national and cultural identity and from the late 19th century onwards Wales acquired its popular image as the "land of song", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition and rousing choir singing. 　Both Welsh and English are official languages. 　A majority of the population in most areas speaks English whilst a majority of the population in parts of the north and west speak Welsh, with a total of 538,300 Welsh speakers across the whole country.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood>Wood</a> </h2>
<p>Wood is a structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. 　It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. 　Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.　[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. 　It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. 　Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or woodchips or fiber. 　Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. 　More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate. 　As of 2020, the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 557 billion cubic meters. 　As an abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. 　In 2008, approximately 3.97 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. 　Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.</p>

<p>A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else. 　A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, thunder is a sign of storm, or medical symptoms a sign of disease. 　A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a language, as well as bodily gestures, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular meanings. 　The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, road signs, etc., collectively known as signage) generally inform or instruct using written text, symbols, pictures or a combination of these. 　The philosophical study of signs and symbols is called semiotics; this includes the study of semiosis, which is the way in which signs (in the semiotic sense) operate.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation>Nation</a> </h2>
<p>A nation is a community of people formed on the basis of a combination of shared features such as language, history, ethnicity, culture and/or society. 　A nation is thus the collective identity of a group of people understood as defined by those features. 　Some nations are equated with ethnic groups (see ethnic nationalism) and some are equated with affiliation to a social and political constitution (see civic nationalism and multiculturalism). 　A nation is generally more overtly political than an ethnic group. 　A nation has also been defined as a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity and particular interests. 　The consensus among scholars is that nations are socially constructed and historically contingent. 　Throughout history, people have had an attachment to their kin group and traditions, territorial authorities and their homeland, but nationalism – the belief that state and nation should align as a nation state – did not become a prominent ideology until the end of the 18th century. 　There are three notable perspectives on how nations developed. 　Primordialism (perennialism), which reflects popular conceptions of nationalism but has largely fallen out of favour among academics, proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon. 　Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a dynamic, evolving phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols, myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism. 　Modernization theory, which has superseded primordialism as the dominant explanation of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible. 　Proponents of modernization theory describe nations as "imagined communities", a term coined by Benedict Anderson. 　A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections and that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences themselves as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. 　For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet. 　Nationalism is consequently seen an "invented tradition" in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. 　A nation's foundational "story" may be built around a combination of ethnic attributes, values and principles, and may be closely connected to narratives of belonging.</p>

<p>In thermodynamics, heat is defined as the form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference across the boundary. 　A thermodynamic system does not contain heat. 　Nevertheless, the term is also often used to refer to the thermal energy contained in a system as a component of its internal energy and that is reflected in the temperature of the system. 　For both uses of the term, heat is a form of energy. 　An example of formal vs. informal usage may be obtained from the right-hand photo, in which the metal bar is "conducting heat" from its hot end to its cold end, but if the metal bar is considered a thermodynamic system, then the energy flowing within the metal bar is called internal energy, not heat. 　The hot metal bar is also transferring heat to its surroundings, a correct statement for both the strict and loose meanings of heat. 　Another example of informal usage is the term heat content, used despite the fact that physics defines heat as energy transfer. 　More accurately, it is thermal energy that is contained in the system or body, as it is stored in the microscopic degrees of freedom of the modes of vibration. 　Heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system, by a mechanism that involves the microscopic atomic modes of motion or the corresponding macroscopic properties. 　This descriptive characterization excludes the transfers of energy by thermodynamic work or mass transfer. 　Defined quantitatively, the heat involved in a process is the difference in internal energy between the final and initial states of a system, and subtracting the work done in the process. 　This is the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics. 　The measurement of energy transferred as heat is called calorimetry, performed by measuring its effect on the states of interacting bodies. 　For example, heat can be measured by the amount of ice melted, or by change in temperature of a body in the surroundings of the system. 　In the International System of Units (SI) the unit of measurement for heat, as a form of energy, is the joule (J).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrology)>Spring (hydrology)</a> </h2>
<p>A spring is a natural exit point at which groundwater emerges out of the aquifer and flows onto the top of the Earth's crust (pedosphere) to become surface water. 　It is a component of the hydrosphere as well as a part of the water cycle. 　Springs have long been important for humans as a source of fresh water, especially in arid regions which have relatively little annual rainfall. 　Springs are driven out onto the surface by various natural forces, such as gravity and hydrostatic pressure. 　A spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater is known as a hot spring. 　The yield of spring water varies widely from a volumetric flow rate of nearly zero to more than 14,000 litres per second (490 cu ft/s) for the biggest springs.</p>

<p>A prize is an award to be given to a person or a group of people (such as sporting teams and organizations) to recognize and reward their actions and achievements. 　Official prizes often involve monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. 　Some prizes are also associated with extravagant awarding ceremonies, such as the Academy Awards. 　Prizes are also given to publicize noteworthy or exemplary behaviour, and to provide incentives for improved outcomes and competitive efforts. 　In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. 　However, many prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy. 　Specific types of prizes include: Booby prize: typically awarded as a joke or insult to whoever finished last (e.g., wooden spoon award). 　Consolation prize: an award given to those who do not win but are deemed worthy of recognition. 　Hierarchical prizes, where the best award is "first prize", "grand prize", or "gold medal". 　Subordinate awards are "second prize", "third prize", etc., or "first runner-up" and "second runner-up", etc., or "silver medal" and "bronze medal". 　(In some contests, "grand prize" is more desirable than "first prize".) 　On game shows in the UK, the term is "star prize", while in Australia, it is "major prize". 　Purchase prize or acquisition prize: a monetary prize given in an art competition in exchange for the winning work. 　Winnings from an inducement prize contest, usually a reward for accomplishing a specific feat of use to the sponsor or society at large</p>

<p>A generation refers to all of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded collectively. 　It can also be described as, "the average period, generally considered to be about 20–⁠30 years, during which children are born and grow up, become adults, and begin to have children." 　In kinship terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child relationship. 　It is known as biogenesis, reproduction, or procreation in the biological sciences. 　Generation is also often used synonymously with birth/age cohort in demographics, marketing, and social science; under this formulation it means "people within a delineated population who experience the same significant events within a given period of time." 　Generations in this sense of birth cohort, also known as "social generations", are widely used in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis. 　Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. 　Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.</p>

<p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. 　It occurs after autumn and before spring. 　The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. 　Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. 　When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. 　In many regions, winter brings snow and freezing temperatures. 　The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. 　The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. 　The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. 　They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see: earliest and latest sunrise and sunset).</p>

<p>Actor (Ancient Greek: Ἄκτωρ; gen.: Ἄκτoρος Aktoros) is a very common name in Greek mythology. 　Here is a selection of characters that share this name (which means 'leader', from the verb άγω: to lead or carry): Actor, father of Eurytus who was an ally of Phineus during his fight with Perseus. 　Actor, a king of Phthia, was said to be the son of King Myrmidon and Peisidice, daughter of Aeolus. 　Some say that Actor died childless, but others say that he is the father of Eurytion, his successor or of Irus, who was also called the father of Eurytion. 　According to Diodorus, Actor without an heir, was succeeded by Peleus who fled to his country from Aegina for killing his half-brother, Phocus. 　The hero was then purified by the king for his sins. 　This story was usually attributed to Actor's possible son Eurytion who was slain accidentally by his son-in-law Peleus. 　This Actor married Aegina, daughter of the river god Asopus, and had several children, among them Menoetius. 　Menoetius was counted among the Argonauts, and was the father of Patroclus (Achilles' very close companion). 　Actor, son of King Deioneus of Phocis and Diomede, daughter of Xuthus, thus a brother of Asterodeia, Aenetus, Phylacus, and Cephalus. 　This Actor could be the man referred by Hesiod as the father of Protesilaus, one of the suitors of Helen of Troy. 　Actor, son of Azeus, descendant of Phrixus, was ruler of the Minyans of Orchomenus. 　He was father of Astyoche, who was seduced by the war-god Ares and bore him twin sons, named Ascalaphus and Ialmenus. 　These last two led the Minyan contingent to the Trojan War. 　Actor, son of Phorbas and Hyrmine, thus a brother of Augeas and Tiphys. 　He was king of Elis, and founded the city of Hyrmina, which he named after his mother. 　This Actor married Molione and became by her father of the twins known as the Molionides, Eurytus and Cteatus. 　Actor, the Epean son of Poseidon and Agamede, daughter of King Augeas. 　He was the brother of Belus and Dictys. 　Actor and Eurythemis were in one source called parents of Ancaeus (who other sources call the son of Lycurgus) and grandparents of Agapenor. 　Actor, the Achaean son of Hippasus from Pellene and one of the Argonauts. 　Actor, a Lapith. 　He was killed by the centaur Clanis. 　Actor, father of Sthenelus. 　Sthenelus followed Heracles in his campaign against the Amazons and was killed by them. 　Actor, son of Acastus, was accidentally killed by Peleus while hunting. 　As a retribution, Peleus sent to Acastus some cows and sheep that had been killed by a wolf sent by Thetis. 　Actor, son of Oenops, brother of Hyperbius. 　He was among the defenders of the Borraean Gate at Thebes when the Seven against Thebes attacked the city, and confronted Parthenopaeus at the gate. 　Actor, a warrior in the army of the Seven against Thebes. 　He saw a chasm open in the earth that swallowed Amphiaraus. 　Actor, an old Theban servant of Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus. 　During the war of the Seven against Thebes, he accompanied her to the walls when that army appeared in front of the barriers outside the city. 　Because of his age, Actor cannot follow the princess and he just stayed halfway up the climb to listen to her lament when she saw her brother in the enemy army. 　Actor, father of Echecles. 　His son married Polymele, mother of Eudoros by Hermes. 　Actor, a shepherd in Lemnos who befriended Philoctetes in Euripides' play Philoctetes. 　According to some accounts, he was instead the king of Lemnos whose shepherd named Iphimachus, son of Dolops, took care the abandoned hero after he was bitten by a snake. 　Actor, one of the companions of the exiled Aeneas. 　He is probably the same who in another passage is called an Auruncan, and of whose conquered lance Turnus made a boast. 　This story seems to have given rise to the proverbial saying "Actoris spolium" ("the spoil of Actor"), for any poor spoil in general. 　Actor, father of Actoris (though unnamed in the Odyssey) who was given by Icarius to his daughter Penelope after her wedding with Odysseus to serve as her personal handmaiden.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor>Actor</a> </h2>
<p>An actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a performance. 　The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television. 　The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally "one who answers". 　The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. 　This can also be considered an "actor's role," which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. 　Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental performance art. 　Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. 　While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts. 　The commedia dell'arte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Italy (and in Europe). 　After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear onstage in England. 　In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball>Baseball</a> </h2>
<p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. 　The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. 　The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". 　The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. 　A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). 　The principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. 　Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called "out" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. 　The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the field of play. 　The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base. 　The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. 　One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. 　A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. 　Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. 　Baseball has no game clock. 　Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. 　This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. 　Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of "America's Pastime"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. 　In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 　In Major League Baseball (MLB), the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. 　The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. 　The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. 　The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world. 　Baseball was played at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated in 2020.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_(geology)>Horse (geology)</a> </h2>
<p>A horse, in geology, is any block of rock completely separated from the surrounding rock either by mineral veins or fault planes. 　In mining, a horse is a block of country rock entirely encased within a mineral lode. 　In structural geology the term was first used to describe the thrust-bounded imbricates found within a thrust duplex. 　In later literature it has become a general term for any block entirely bounded by faults, whether the overall deformation type is contractional, extensional or strike-slip in nature.</p>
