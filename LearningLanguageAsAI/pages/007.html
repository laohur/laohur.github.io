<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory>Theory</a> </h2>
<p>A theory is a rational type of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or the results of such thinking. 　The process of contemplative and rational thinking is often associated with such processes as observational study or research. 　Theories may be scientific, belong to a non-scientific discipline, or no discipline at all. 　Depending on the context, a theory's assertions might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works. 　The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings. 　In modern science, the term "theory" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with the scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science. 　Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, or empirical contradiction ("falsify") of it. 　Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word hypothesis). 　Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions. 　Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.　: 131  A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models. 　To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.　: 46  The word theory or "in theory" is sometimes used erroneously by people to explain something which they individually did not experience or test before. 　In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another concept, a hypothesis. 　Instead of using the word "hypothetically", it is replaced by a phrase: "in theory". 　In some instances the theory's credibility could be contested by calling it "just a theory" (implying that the idea has not even been tested). 　Hence, that word "theory" is very often contrasted to "practice" (from Greek praxis, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for doing, which is opposed to theory. 　A "classical example" of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. 　These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television>Television</a> </h2>
<p>Television, sometimes shortened to TV, is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound. 　The term can refer to a television set, or the medium of television transmission. 　Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports. 　Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. 　After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. 　During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. 　In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries. 　The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule. 　For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video-on-demand service by Netflix). 　At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. 　Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. 　HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. 　Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer and Hulu. 　In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. 　The replacement of earlier cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), OLED displays, and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. 　Most television sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. 　Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, Digital Light Processing (DLP), plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. 　In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs. 　Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s. 　Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s. 　Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency television transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. 　Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. 　Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television was expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. 　A standard television set consists of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. 　A visual display device that lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall>Hall</a> </h2>
<p>In architecture, a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls. 　In the Iron Age and early Middle Ages in northern Europe, a mead hall was where a lord and his retainers ate and also slept. 　Later in the Middle Ages, the great hall was the largest room in castles and large houses, and where the servants usually slept. 　As more complex house plans developed, the hall remained a large room for dancing and large feasts, often still with servants sleeping there. 　It was usually immediately inside the main door. 　In modern British houses, an entrance hall next to the front door remains an indispensable feature, even if it is essentially merely a corridor. 　Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly. 　Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor (from Spanish corredor used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard), or hallway.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio>Radio</a> </h2>
<p>Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves. 　Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz). 　They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves, and received by another antenna connected to a radio receiver. 　Radio is widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, radar, radio navigation, remote control, remote sensing, and other applications. 　In radio communication, used in radio and television broadcasting, cell phones, two-way radios, wireless networking, and satellite communication, among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by modulating the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. 　In radar, used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves reveal the object's location. 　In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR, a mobile receiver accepts radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth. 　In wireless radio remote control devices like drones, garage door openers, and keyless entry systems, radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device. 　Applications of radio waves that do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens, and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines, are not usually called radio. 　The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver. 　The existence of radio waves was first proven by German physicist Heinrich Hertz on November 11, 1886. 　In the mid 1890s, building on techniques physicists were using to study electromagnetic waves, Guglielmo Marconi developed the first apparatus for long-distance radio communication, sending a wireless Morse Code message to a source over a kilometer away in 1895, and the first transatlantic signal on December 12, 1901. 　The first commercial radio broadcast was transmitted on November 2, 1920 when the live returns of the Harding-Cox presidential election were broadcast by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh, under the call sign KDKA. 　The emission of radio waves is regulated by law, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which allocates frequency bands in the radio spectrum for different uses.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart>Heart</a> </h2>
<p>The heart is a muscular organ in most animals. 　This organ pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. 　The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs. 　In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest. 　In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. 　Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. 　Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while most reptiles have three chambers. 　In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. 　The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. 　The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. 　The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. 　These generate a current that causes the heart to contract, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. 　In humans, deoxygenated blood enters the heart through the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes it to the right ventricle. 　From here it is pumped into pulmonary circulation to the lungs, where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. 　Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta into systemic circulation, traveling through arteries, arterioles, and capillaries—where nutrients and other substances are exchanged between blood vessels and cells, losing oxygen and gaining carbon dioxide—before being returned to the heart through venules and veins. 　The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. 　Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers it in the long term, and is good for heart health. 　Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. 　Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. 　Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. 　Cardiovascular diseases do not frequently have symptoms but may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. 　Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, echocardiogram, and ultrasound. 　Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment. 　A teenager's heartbeat Sounds of a healthy 16-year-old child's heart beating normally, as heard with a stethoscope. 　Problems playing this file? 　See media help.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England>England</a> </h2>
<p>England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. 　It shares land borders with Wales to its west and Scotland to its north. 　The Irish Sea lies northwest and the Celtic Sea area of the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. 　It is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. 　The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain, which lies in the North Atlantic, and includes over 100 smaller islands, such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight. 　The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic period, but takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula, who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. 　England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century. 　The English language, the Anglican Church, and English law—the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world—developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations. 　The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation. 　England's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. 　However, there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the Lake District and Pennines) and in the west (for example, Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills). 　The capital is London, which has the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. 　England's population of 56.3 million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century. 　The Kingdom of England – which after 1535 included Wales – ceased being a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. 　In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland (through another Act of Union) to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. 　In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind>Mind</a> </h2>
<p>The mind is the set of faculties responsible for all mental phenomena. 　Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves. 　These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will, and sensation. 　They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention, and emotion. 　Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed. 　Important distinctions group them according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious, or occurrent. 　Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals. 　Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed. 　Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states. 　Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind. 　According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental. 　For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play. 　Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition. 　Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter or physicality. 　The issue of the nature of this contrast and specifically the relation between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem. 　Traditional viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which consider the mind to be non-physical. 　Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity[need quotation to verify] though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. 　Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds.　[citation needed] For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines.　[citation needed] Different cultural and religious traditions often use different concepts of mind, resulting in different answers to these questions. 　Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities. 　Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers. 　Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. 　The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind. 　The mind is also sometimes portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.</p>

<p>Lead is a chemical element with the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and atomic number 82. 　It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. 　Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low melting point. 　When freshly cut, lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue. 　It tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. 　Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements. 　Lead is toxic, even in small amounts, especially to children. 　Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal. 　Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. 　Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. 　Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. 　Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains and polyhedral structures. 　Since lead is easily extracted from its ores, prehistoric people in the Near East were aware of it. 　Galena is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver. 　Interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome. 　Lead production declined after the fall of Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. 　Lead played a crucial role in the development of the printing press, as movable type could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys. 　In 2014, the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. 　Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. 　These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding. 　Lead's toxicity became widely recognized in the late 19th century, although a number of well-educated ancient Greek and Roman writers were aware of this fact and even knew some of the symptoms of lead poisoning. 　Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones; it damages the nervous system and interferes with the function of biological enzymes, causing neurological disorders ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage, and also affects general health, cardiovascular, and renal systems.</p>

<p>A lead in hydrocarbon exploration, is a subsurface structural or stratigraphic feature with the potential to have entrapped oil or natural gas. 　When exploring a new area, or when new data becomes available in existing acreage, an explorer will carry out an initial screening to identify possible leads. 　Further work is then concentrated on the leads with the intention to mature at least some of them into drillable prospects.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep>Keep</a> </h2>
<p>A keep (from the Middle English kype) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility. 　Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. 　The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England, south Italy and Sicily. 　As a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, use spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. 　The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. 　Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade or more to build. 　During the 12th century, new designs began to be introduced – in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. 　By the end of the century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without keeps. 　In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall fighting towers called bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. 　In the second half of the 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. 　In France, the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. 　Meanwhile, tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period. 　In the 15th century, the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery. 　For example, in 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, the keep of Bamburgh Castle on the Northumberland coast, previously considered to be impregnable, was defeated with bombards. 　By the 16th century, keeps were slowly falling out of fashion as fortifications and residences. 　Many were destroyed in civil wars between the 17th and 18th centuries or incorporated into gardens as an alternative to follies. 　During the 19th century, keeps became fashionable once again and in England and France, a number were restored or redesigned by Gothic architects. 　Despite further damage to many French and Spanish keeps during the wars of the 20th century, keeps now form an important part of the tourist and heritage industry in Europe.</p>

<p>Health, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". 　A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. 　Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. 　Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. 　Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(game terminology)>Health (game terminology)</a> </h2>
<p>Health is an attribute in a video game or tabletop game that determines the maximum amount of damage or loss of stamina that a character or object can take before dying or losing consciousness. 　In role-playing games, this typically takes the form of hit points (HP), a numerical attribute representing the health of a character or object. 　The game character can be a player character, a boss, or a mob. 　Health can also be attributed to destructible elements of the game environment or inanimate objects such as vehicles and their individual parts. 　In video games, health is often represented by visual elements such as a numerical fraction, a health bar or a series of small icons, though it may also be represented acoustically, such as through a character's heartbeat.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person>Person</a> </h2>
<p>A person (PL: people) is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. 　The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts. 　In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes. 　The plural form "people" is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in "a people"), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. 　The plural form "persons" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.</p>

<p>A cup is an open-top used to hold hot or cold liquids for pouring or drinking; while mainly used for drinking, it also can be used to store solids for pouring (e.g., sugar, flour, grains, salt). 　Cups may be made of glass, metal, china, clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, or other adornments. 　Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes, and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations. 　Cups of different styles may be used for different types of liquids or other foodstuffs (e.g. teacups and measuring cups), in different situations (e.g. at water stations or in ceremonies and rituals), or for decoration.</p>
