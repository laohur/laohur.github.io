<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics>Ethics</a> </h2>
<p>Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that "involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior". 　The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value; these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called axiology. 　Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. 　As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory. 　Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are: Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined; Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action; Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer>Hammer</a> </h2>
<p>A hammer is a tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted "head" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object. 　This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock. 　Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications. 　Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong). 　Hammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to prying with a secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook. 　Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, in a lengthy downward planar arc—downward to add kinetic energy to the impact—pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring). 　War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets. 　Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes. 　Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip. 　The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic. 　Ubiquitous in framing, the claw hammer has a "claw" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America. 　Other types of hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. 　Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers. 　Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, such as steam hammers and trip hammers, are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm. 　There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses. 　For hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration. 　Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand, turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile. 　Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration; steel is also a good conductor of heat, making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions. 　Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation. 　A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use. 　Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, but lack strength and durability compared to steel, and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft. 　The high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic anvil. 　In terms of human physiology, many uses of the hammer involve coordinated ballistic movements under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the neuromuscular level, as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight. 　For this reason, accurate striking at speed requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area. 　It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of throwing, clubbing, and hammering precipitated aspects of brain evolution in early hominids.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight>Insight</a> </h2>
<p>Insight is the understanding of a specific cause and effect within a particular context. 　The term insight can have several related meanings: a piece of information the act or result of understanding the inner nature of things or of seeing intuitively (called noesis in Greek) an introspection the power of acute observation and deduction, discernment, and perception, called intellection or noesis An understanding of cause and effect based on the identification of relationships and behaviors within a model, context, or scenario (see artificial intelligence) An insight that manifests itself suddenly, such as understanding how to solve a difficult problem, is sometimes called by the German word Aha-Erlebnis. 　The term was coined by the German psychologist and theoretical linguist Karl Bühler. 　It is also known as an epiphany, eureka moment or (for cross word solvers) the penny dropping moment (PDM). 　Sudden sickening realisations often identify a problem rather than solving it, so Uh-oh rather than Aha moments are further seen in negative insight. 　A further example of negative insight is chagrin which is annoyance at the obviousness of a solution missed up until the point of insight, an example of this being the Homer Simpson's catchphrase exclamation, D'oh!　.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy>Hierarchy</a> </h2>
<p>A hierarchy (from Greek: ἱεραρχία, hierarkhia, 'rule of a high priest', from hierarkhes, 'president of sacred rites') is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) that are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another. 　Hierarchy is an important concept in a wide variety of fields, such as architecture, philosophy, design, mathematics, computer science, organizational theory, systems theory, systematic biology, and the social sciences (especially political philosophy). 　A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. 　The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. 　Hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a path. 　All parts of the hierarchy that are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be "horizontally" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. 　This is akin to two co-workers or colleagues; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. 　Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. 　Heterarchy is one such form.</p>

<p>Santiago (/ˌsæntiˈɑːɡoʊ/, US also /ˌsɑːn-/; Spanish: [sanˈtjaɣo]), also known as Santiago de Chile, is the capital and largest city of Chile and one of the largest cities in the Americas. 　It is located in the country's central valley and is the center of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 8 million, representing nearly 40% of Chile's total population. 　Most of the city is situated between 500–650 m (1,640–2,133 ft) above sea level. 　Founded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, Santiago has served as the capital city of Chile since colonial times. 　The city has a downtown core of 19th-century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets featuring a mix of art deco, neo-gothic, and other styles. 　Santiago's cityscape is defined by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River, which is lined by parks such as Parque Forestal and Balmaceda Park. 　The Andes Mountains can be seen from most parts of the city and contribute to a smog problem, particularly during winter, due to the lack of rain. 　The outskirts of the city are surrounded by vineyards, and Santiago is within an hour's drive of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. 　Santiago is the political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations. 　The Chilean executive and judiciary branches are based in Santiago, while the Congress mostly meets in nearby Valparaíso.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing>Editing</a> </h2>
<p>Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written, photographic, visual, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an entity to convey a message or information. 　The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organisation, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of work. 　The editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. 　Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods. 　There are various editorial positions in publishing. 　Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. 　Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. 　The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap. 　The top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor. 　A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor. 　Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. 　In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor. 　In the book publishing industry, editors may organize anthologies and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor). 　Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an acquisitions editor or a commissioning editor in a publishing house. 　Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor. 　Copy editors correct spelling, grammar and align writings to house style. 　Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors. 　At newspapers and wire services, press or copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. 　In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion. 　At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is sub-editor. 　They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. 　These editors may have the title of layout or design editor or (more so in the past) makeup editor.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil>Fossil</a> </h2>
<p>A fossil (from Classical Latin fossilis, lit. 'obtained by digging') is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. 　Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood and DNA remnants. 　The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record. 　Paleontology is the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance. 　Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old. 　The oldest fossils are around 3.48 billion years old to 4.1 billion years old. 　The observation in the 19th century that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led to the recognition of a geological timescale and the relative ages of different fossils. 　The development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the absolute ages of rocks and the fossils they host. 　There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration. 　Fossils vary in size from one-micrometre (1 µm) bacteria to dinosaurs and trees, many meters long and weighing many tons. 　A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life, such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates, or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates. 　Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, such as animal tracks or feces (coprolites). 　These types of fossil are called trace fossils or ichnofossils, as opposed to body fossils. 　Some fossils are biochemical and are called chemofossils or biosignatures.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle>Chronicle</a> </h2>
<p>A chronicle (Latin: chronica, from Greek χρονικά chroniká, from χρόνος, chrónos – "time") is a historical account of events arranged in chronological order, as in a timeline. 　Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. 　A chronicle which traces world history is a universal chronicle. 　This is in contrast to a narrative or history, in which an author chooses events to interpret and analyze and excludes those the author does not consider important or relevant. 　The information sources for chronicles vary. 　Some are written from the chronicler's direct knowledge, others from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition. 　Some used written material, such as charters, letters, and earlier chronicles. 　Still others are tales of unknown origin that have mythical status. 　Copyists also changed chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original chronicler. 　Determining the reliability of particular chronicles is important to historians. 　Many newspapers and other periodical literature have adopted "chronicle" as part of their name. 　Various fictional stories have also adopted "chronicle" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner>Banner</a> </h2>
<p>A banner can be a flag or another piece of cloth bearing a symbol, logo, slogan or another message. 　A flag whose design is the same as the shield in a coat of arms (but usually in a square or rectangular shape) is called a banner of arms. 　Also, a bar-shaped piece of non-cloth advertising material sporting a name, slogan, or other marketing message is also a banner. 　Banner-making is an ancient craft. 　Church banners commonly portray the saint to whom the church is dedicated. 　The word derives from Old French baniere (modern French: bannière), from Late Latin bandum, which was borrowed from a Germanic source (compare Gothic: 𐌱𐌰𐌽𐌳𐍅𐌰, romanized: bandwa). 　Cognates include Italian bandiera, Portuguese bandeira, and Spanish bandera.</p>

<p>Alumni (singular: alumnus (masculine) or alumna (feminine)) are former students of a school, college, or university who have either attended or graduated in some fashion from the institution. 　The feminine plural alumnae is sometimes used for groups of women. 　The word is Latin and means "one who is being (or has been) nourished". 　The term is not synonymous with "graduate"; one can be an alumnus without graduating (Burt Reynolds, alumnus but not graduate of Florida State University, is an example). 　The term is sometimes used to refer to a former employee or member of an organization, contributor, or inmate.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster>Westminster</a> </h2>
<p>Westminster is a city and area of Central London, England, within the larger City of Westminster, most notable for being the seat of the majority of government institutions in the United Kingdom. 　The area, which extends from the River Thames to Oxford Street, has many visitor attractions and historic landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and much of the West End shopping and entertainment district. 　The name (Old English: Westmynstre) originated from the informal description of the abbey church and royal peculiar of St Peter's (Westminster Abbey), west of the City of London (until the English Reformation there was also an Eastminster, near the Tower of London, in the East End of London). 　The abbey's origins date from between the 7th and 10th centuries, but it rose to national prominence when rebuilt by Edward the Confessor in the 11th. 　Westminster has been the home of England's government since about 1200, and from 1707 the Government of the United Kingdom. 　In 1539, it became a city. 　Westminster is often used as a metonym to refer to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, in the Palace of Westminster.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense>Expense</a> </h2>
<p>An expense is an item requiring an outflow of money, or any form of fortune in general, to another person or group as payment for an item, service, or other category of costs. 　For a tenant, rent is an expense. 　For students or parents, tuition is an expense. 　Buying food, clothing, furniture, or an automobile is often referred to as an expense. 　An expense is a cost that is "paid" or "remitted", usually in exchange for something of value. 　Something that seems to cost a great deal is "expensive". 　Something that seems to cost little is "inexpensive". 　"Expenses of the table" are expenses for dining, refreshments, a feast, etc. 　In accounting, expense is any specific outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. 　This outflow is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller. 　Technically, an expense is an event in which a proprietary stake is diminished or exhausted, or a liability is incurred. 　In terms of the accounting equation, expenses reduce owners' equity. 　The International Accounting Standards Board defines expenses as: ...decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants. 　Expense is a term also used in sociology, in which a particular fortune or price is sacrificed voluntarily or involuntarily by something or someone to something or somebody else, often in the context that the latter is taking advantage of the former.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle>Motorcycle</a> </h2>
<p>A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or trike (if three-wheeled)) is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat. 　Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. 　Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. 　The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. 　In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle. 　Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. 　In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world, fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over the same period. 　In 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki. 　In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. 　Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.　[citation needed] According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.</p>
