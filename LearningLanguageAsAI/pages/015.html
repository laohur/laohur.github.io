<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist>Artist</a> </h2>
<p>An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. 　The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. 　However, the term is also often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (although less often for actors). 　"Artiste" (French for artist) is a variant used in English in this context, but this use has become rare. 　Use of the term "artist" to describe writers is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like used in criticism.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun>Sun</a> </h2>
<p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 　It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. 　The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth. 　The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. 　Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. 　Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. 　The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). 　As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white). 　It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. 　Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. 　The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. 　It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. 　Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. 　This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. 　When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. 　It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. 　After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion. 　The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. 　The Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity. 　The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of some solar calendars. 　The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based upon the standard 16th-century interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain>Mountain</a> </h2>
<p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. 　Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land. 　A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges. 　Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. 　Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers. 　High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. 　These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. 　Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing. 　The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. 　The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold>Cold</a> </h2>
<p>Cold is the presence of low temperature, especially in the atmosphere. 　In common usage, cold is often a subjective perception. 　A lower bound to temperature is absolute zero, defined as 0.00 K on the Kelvin scale, an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. 　This corresponds to −273.15 °C on the Celsius scale, −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale, and 0.00 °R on the Rankine scale. 　Since temperature relates to the thermal energy held by an object or a sample of matter, which is the kinetic energy of the random motion of the particle constituents of matter, an object will have less thermal energy when it is colder and more when it is hotter. 　If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all motion of the particles in a sample of matter would cease and they would be at complete rest in the classical sense. 　The object could be described as having zero thermal energy. 　Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty principle.</p>

<p>In archaeological excavation, a feature is a collection of one or more contexts representing some human non-portable activity, such as a hearth or wall. 　Features serve as an indication that the area in which they are found has been interfered with in the past, usually by humans. 　Features are distinguished from artifacts in that they cannot be separated from their location without changing their form. 　Artifacts are portable, while features are non-portable. 　Artifacts and features can both be made from any available material, with the primary distinction being portability. 　Features and artifacts differ from ecofacts. 　Ecofacts are natural remains, such as plants and animals.</p>

If more than one person created the work (i.e., multiple authors), then a case of joint authorship takes place. Copyright laws differ around the world. The United States Copyright Office, for example, defines copyright as "a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of 'original works of authorship.　'"</p>

<p>Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter – the others being solid, liquid, and plasma. 　A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). 　A gas mixture, such as air, contains a variety of pure gases. 　What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. 　This separation usually makes a colourless gas invisible to the human observer. 　The gaseous state of matter occurs between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. 　Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention. 　High-density atomic gases super-cooled to very low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases. 　For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter.</p>

<p>Temperature is a physical quantity that expresses quantitatively the perceptions of hotness and coldness. 　Temperature is measured with a thermometer. 　Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature scales that historically have relied on various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. 　The most common scales are the Celsius scale with the unit symbol °C (formerly called centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale (K), the latter being used predominantly for scientific purposes. 　The kelvin is one of the seven base units in the International System of Units (SI). 　Absolute zero, i.e., zero kelvin or −273.15 °C, is the lowest point in the thermodynamic temperature scale. 　Experimentally, it can be approached very closely but not actually reached, as recognized in the third law of thermodynamics. 　It would be impossible to extract energy as heat from a body at that temperature. 　Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, medicine, biology, ecology, material science, metallurgy, mechanical engineering and geography as well as most aspects of daily life.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture>Culture</a> </h2>
<p>Culture (/ˈkʌltʃər/) is an umbrella term which encompasses the collective social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, which includes the collective knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. 　Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location. 　Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies. 　A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group. 　Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change. 　Thus in military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. 　In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group. 　Cultural formation and change is the formation and reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society. 　Cultures are formed or affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. 　Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies. 　Organizations like UNESCO attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers, usually actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. 　The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. 　Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. 　The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe"). 　Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. 　Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature and the arts in general. 　A theatre company is an organisation that produces theatrical performances, as distinct from a theatre troupe (or acting company), which is a group of theatrical performers working together. 　Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre. 　The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. 　They were influential to the development of musical theatre.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_(mythology)>Paris (mythology)</a> </h2>
<p>Paris (Ancient Greek: Πάρις), also known as Alexander (Ἀλέξανδρος, Aléxandros), the son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, is a mythological nobleman that appears in a number of Greek legends. 　Of these appearances, probably the best known was the elopement with Helen, queen of Sparta, this being one of the immediate causes of the Trojan War. 　Later in the war, he fatally wounds Achilles in the heel with an arrow as foretold by Achilles's mother, Thetis. 　The name Paris is probably of Luwian origin, and comparable to Pari-zitis, attested as a Hittite scribe's name. 　The name Paris is etymologically unrelated to the name of the French city of Paris, which derives its name from a Gaulish tribe called the Parisii.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice>Justice</a> </h2>
<p>Justice, in its broadest sense, is the principle that people receive that which they deserve, with the interpretation of what then constitutes "deserving" being impacted upon by numerous fields, with many differing viewpoints and perspectives, including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics, rationality, law, religion, equity and fairness. 　The state will sometimes endeavor to increase justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings. 　Early theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic, and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. 　Advocates of divine command theory have said that justice issues from God. 　In the 17th century, philosophers such as John Locke said that justice derives from natural law. 　Social contract theory said that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone. 　In the 19th century, utilitarian philosophers such as John Stuart Mill said that justice is based on the best outcomes for the greatest number of people. 　Theories of distributive justice study what is to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. 　Egalitarians have said that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. 　John Rawls used a social contract theory to say that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. 　Robert Nozick and others said that property rights, also within the realm of distributive justice and natural law, maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. 　Theories of retributive justice say that wrongdoing should be punished to ensure justice. 　The closely related restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant>Plant</a> </h2>
<p>Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. 　Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). 　By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants") which is sister of the Glaucophyta, and consists of the green algae and Embryophyta (land plants). 　The latter includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, and mosses. 　Most plants are multicellular organisms. 　Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. 　Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. 　Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. 　Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, however asexual reproduction is also common. 　There are about 320,000 known species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260,000–290,000, produce seeds. 　Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems. 　Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. 　Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs. 　The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.</p>

<p>In mathematics, and more particularly in set theory, a cover (or covering) of a set X {\displaystyle X} is a family of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} whose union is all of X {\displaystyle X} . 　More formally, if C = { U α : α ∈ A } {\displaystyle C=\lbrace U_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\rbrace } is an indexed family of subsets U α ⊂ X {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }\subset X} (indexed by the set A {\displaystyle A} ), then C {\displaystyle C} is a cover of X {\displaystyle X} if ⋃ α ∈ A U α = X {\displaystyle \bigcup _{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha }=X} . 　Thus the collection { U α : α ∈ A } {\displaystyle \lbrace U_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\rbrace } is a cover of X {\displaystyle X} if each element of X {\displaystyle X} belongs to at least one of the subsets U α {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }} . 　A subcover of a cover of a set is a subset of the cover that also covers the set. 　A cover is called an open cover if each of its element is an open set.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest>Forest</a> </h2>
<p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. 　Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function. 　The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use." 　Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020. 　Forests are the predominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are found around the globe. 　More than half of the world's forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, Russia, and the United States). 　The largest share of forests (45 percent) are in the tropical latitudes, followed by those in the boreal, temperate, and subtropic domains. 　Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. 　Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of biomass per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests. 　Forests at different latitudes and elevations, and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration form distinctly different biomes: boreal forests around the North Pole, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. 　Areas at higher elevations tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and the amount of precipitation also affects forest composition. 　Almost half the forest area (49 percent) is relatively intact, while 9 percent is found in fragments with little or no connectivity. 　Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. 　Roughly 80 percent of the world's forest area is found in patches larger than 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres). 　The remaining 20 percent is located in more than 34 million patches around the world – the vast majority less than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in size. 　Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways. 　Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. 　Forests can also affect people's health. 　Human activities, including unsustainable use of forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling>Feeling</a> </h2>
<p>Feelings are subjective self-contained phenomenal experiences. 　According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, a feeling is "a self-contained phenomenal experience"; and feelings are "subjective, evaluative, and independent of the sensations, thoughts, or images evoking them". 　The term feeling is closely related to, but not the same as emotion. 　"Feeling" may for instance refer to the conscious subjective experience of emotions. 　The study of subjective experiences is referred to as phenomenology. 　The discipline of psychotherapy generally involves a therapist helping a client understand, articulate and learn to effectively regulate their own feelings and ultimately take responsibility for their experience of the world. 　Feelings are sometimes held to be characteristic of embodied consciousness. 　The English noun feelings may generally refer to any degree of subjectivity in perception or sensation. 　However, feelings often refer to an individual sense of well-being (perhaps of wholeness, safety or being loved.) Feelings have a semantic field extending from the individual and spiritual to the social and political. 　The word feeling may refer to any of a number of psychological characteristics of experience, or even to reflect the entire inner life of the individual (see mood.) As self-contained phenomenal experiences, evoked by sensations and perceptions, we might expect feelings to strongly influence the character of subjective reality; and indeed feelings may sometimes be seen to harbor bias or to in some way distort veridical perception, in particular through projection, wishful thinking, among many other such effects. 　Feeling may also describe the senses, with an exemplary case being the physical sensation of touch.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location>Location</a> </h2>
<p>In geography, location or place are used to denote a region (point, line, or area) on Earth's surface or elsewhere. 　The term location generally implies a higher degree of certainty than place, the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of place identity and sense of place than on geometry.</p>
