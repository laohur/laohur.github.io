<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform>Uniform</a> </h2>
<p>A uniform is a variety of costume worn by members of an organization while participating in that organization's activity. 　Modern uniforms are most often worn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency services, security guards, in some workplaces and schools and by inmates in prisons. 　In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service or the French prefects. 　For some organizations, such as police, it may be illegal for non members to wear the uniform.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting>Shooting</a> </h2>
<p>Shooting is the act or process of discharging a projectile from a ranged weapon (such as a gun, bow, crossbow, slingshot, or blowpipe). 　Even the acts of launching flame, artillery, darts, harpoons, grenades, rockets, and guided missiles can be considered acts of shooting. 　When using a firearm, the act of shooting is often called firing as it involves initiating a combustion (deflagration) of chemical propellants. 　Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field, in shooting sports, hunting, or in combat. 　The person involved in the shooting activity is called a shooter. 　A skilled, accurate shooter is a marksman or sharpshooter, and a person's level of shooting proficiency is referred to as their marksmanship.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey>Turkey</a> </h2>
<p>Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye [ˈtyɾcije]), officially the Republic of Türkiye (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti [ˈtyɾcije dʒumˈhuːɾijeti] (listen)), is a transcontinental country located mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia, with a small portion on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe. 　It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest. 　Cyprus is off the south coast. 　Most people are Turks, and Kurds are the largest minority. 　Ankara is Turkey's capital, while Istanbul is its largest city and financial centre. 　One of the world's earliest permanently settled regions, present-day Turkey was home to important Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe, and was inhabited by ancient civilisations including the Hattians, Hittites, Anatolian peoples, Mycenaean Greeks, Persians and others. 　Following the conquests of Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient regions were culturally Hellenised, and this continued during the Byzantine era. 　The Seljuk Turks began migrating in the 11th century, and the Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities. 　Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and conquered the Balkans, and the Turkification of Anatolia increased during the Ottoman period. 　After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power. 　From the late 18th century onwards, the empire's power declined with a gradual loss of territories. 　Mahmud II started a period of modernisation in the early 19th century. 　The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restricted the authority of the Sultan and restored the Ottoman Parliament after a 30-year suspension, ushering the empire into a multi-party period. 　The Three Pashas took control with the 1913 coup d'état, and entered World War I as one of the Central Powers in 1914. 　During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek and Assyrian subjects. 　After its defeat in the war, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned. 　The Turkish War of Independence against the occupying Allied Powers resulted in the abolition of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres) on 24 July 1923 and the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923. 　With the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey became a secular, unitary and parliamentary republic. 　Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the Allies. 　Turkey played a prominent role in the Korean War and joined NATO in 1952. 　During the Cold War years, the country endured two military coups in 1960 and 1980, and a period of economic and political turmoil in the 1970s. 　The economy was liberalised in the 1980s, leading to stronger economic growth and political stability. 　Since 2002, the country's political system has been dominated by the AKP and its leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, under whom a decade of rapid growth in nominal GDP took place until 2013, which was followed by a period of recession and stagnation in terms of USD-based nominal GDP between 2013 and 2020, and high inflation as of 2023. 　The AKP government's initial economic achievements, which were financed through privatization revenues and loans, were overshadowed by democratic backsliding and an erosion in the separation of powers and civil liberties, which gained momentum after the parliamentary republic was replaced by an executive presidential system with a referendum in 2017. 　Turkey is a regional power with a geopolitically significant strategic location. 　The economy of Turkey, which is a founding member of the OECD and G20, is classified among the E7, EAGLEs and NICs, and currently ranks twentieth-largest in the world by nominal GDP and eleventh-largest by PPP. 　Turkey is a charter member of the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank; a founding member of the OSCE, OIC, BSEC, ECO, MIKTA, TURKSOY and OTS; and an early member of NATO. 　After becoming one of the early members of the Council of Europe in 1950, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995, and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. 　Turkey has a rich cultural legacy shaped by centuries of history and the influence of the various peoples that have inhabited its territory over several millennia; it is home to 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is among the most visited countries in the world.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion>Billion</a> </h2>
<p>Billion is a word for a large number, and it has two distinct definitions: 1,000,000,000, i.e. one thousand million, or 109 (ten to the ninth power), as defined on the short scale. 　This is its only current meaning in English. 　1,000,000,000,000, i.e. one million million, or 1012 (ten to the twelfth power), as defined on the long scale. 　This number, which is one thousand times larger than the short scale billion, is now referred to in English as one trillion. 　However, this number is the historical meaning in English for the word "billion" (with the exception of the United States), a meaning which was still in official use in British English until some time after World War II. 　American English adopted the short scale definition from the French (it enjoyed usage in France at the time, alongside the long-scale definition). 　The United Kingdom used the long scale billion until 1974, when the government officially switched to the short scale, but since the 1950s the short scale had already been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism. 　Other countries use the word billion (or words cognate to it) to denote either the long scale or short scale billion. 　Milliard, another term for one thousand million, is extremely rare in English, but words similar to it are very common in other European languages. 　For example, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Hebrew (Asia), Hungarian, Italian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish (although the expression mil millones — a thousand million — is far more common), Swedish, Tajik, Turkish, Ukrainian and Uzbek — use milliard, or a related word, for the short scale billion, and billion (or a related word) for the long scale billion. 　Thus for these languages billion is a thousand times larger than the modern English billion.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali>Ali</a> </h2>
<p>ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (Arabic: عَلِيّ بْن أَبِي طَالِب; c. 600 – 661 CE) was the last of four Rightly Guided Caliphs to rule Islam (r. 656–661) immediately after the death of Muhammad, and he was the first Shia Imam. 　The issue of succession caused a major rift between Muslims and divided them into two major branches: Shia following an appointed hereditary leadership among Ali's descendants, and Sunni following political dynasties. 　Ali's assassination in the Grand Mosque of Kufa by a Kharijite coincided with the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate. 　The Imam Ali Shrine and the city of Najaf were built around Ali's tomb and it is visited yearly by millions of devotees. 　Ali was a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, raised by him from the age of 5, and accepted his claim of divine revelation by age 11, being among the first to do so. 　Ali played a pivotal role in the early years of Islam while Muhammad was in Mecca and under severe persecution. 　After Muhammad's relocation to Medina in 622, Ali married his daughter Fatima and, among others, fathered Hasan and Husayn, the second and third Shia Imams. 　Muhammad called him his brother, guardian and successor, and he was the flag bearer in most of the wars and became famous for his bravery. 　On his return from the Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad uttered the phrase, "Whoever I am his Mawla, this Ali is his Mawla." 　But the meaning of Mawla became disputed. 　Shias believed that Ali was appointed by Muhammad to lead Islam, and Sunnis interpreted the word as friendship and love. 　While Ali was preparing Muhammad's body for burial, a group of Muslims met and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr. 　Ali pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr, after six months, but did not take part in the wars and political activity, except for the election of Uthman, the third caliph. 　However, he advised the three caliphs in religious, judicial, and political matters. 　After Uthman was killed, Ali was elected as the next Caliph, which coincided with the first civil wars between Muslims. 　Ali faced two separate opposition forces: a group in Mecca, who wanted to convene a council to determine the caliphate; and another group led by Mu'awiya in the Levant, who demanded revenge for Uthman's blood. 　He defeated the first group; but in the end, the Battle of Siffin led to an arbitration that favored Mu'awiya, who eventually defeated Ali militarily. 　Slain by the sword of Ibn Muljam Moradi, Ali was buried outside the city of Kufa. 　In the eyes of his admirers, he became an example of piety and un-corrupted Islam, as well as the chivalry of pre-Islamic Arabia. 　Several books are dedicated to his hadiths, sermons, and prayers, the most famous of which is Nahj al-Balagha.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf>Wolf</a> </h2>
<p>The wolf (Canis lupus; PL: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. 　More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog, though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise wild subspecies. 　The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. 　The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. 　The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white. 　Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour, including individual or group howling. 　It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. 　Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. 　Wolves are also territorial, and fights over territory are among the principal causes of mortality. 　The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. 　Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. 　Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies virus, may infect wolves. 　The global wild wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 　Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of their attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. 　The wolf is also considered the ancestor of the domestic dog. 　Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. 　Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, farmers, ranchers, and shepherds.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect>Architect</a> </h2>
<p>An architect is a person who plans, designs and oversees the construction of buildings. 　To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose. 　Etymologically, the term architect derives from the Latin architectuscode: lat promoted to code: la , which derives from the Greek (arkhi-, chief + tekton, builder), i.e., chief builder. 　The professional requirements for architects vary from location to location. 　An architect's decisions affect public safety and thus the architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. 　Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played a pivotal role in the development of the profession.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear>Wear</a> </h2>
<p>Wear is the damaging, gradual removal or deformation of material at solid surfaces. 　Causes of wear can be mechanical (e.g., erosion) or chemical (e.g., corrosion). 　The study of wear and related processes is referred to as tribology. 　Wear in machine elements, together with other processes such as fatigue and creep, causes functional surfaces to degrade, eventually leading to material failure or loss of functionality. 　Thus, wear has large economic relevance as first outlined in the Jost Report. 　Abrasive wear alone has been estimated to cost 1-4% of the gross national product of industrialized nations. 　Wear of metals occurs by plastic displacement of surface and near-surface material and by detachment of particles that form wear debris. 　The particle size may vary from millimeters to nanometers. 　This process may occur by contact with other metals, nonmetallic solids, flowing liquids, solid particles or liquid droplets entrained in flowing gasses. 　The wear rate is affected by factors such as type of loading (e.g., impact, static, dynamic), type of motion (e.g., sliding, rolling), temperature, and lubrication, in particular by the process of deposition and wearing out of the boundary lubrication layer. 　Depending on the tribosystem, different wear types and wear mechanisms can be observed.</p>

<p>Coordinates: 63°N 16°E﻿ / ﻿63°N 16°E﻿ / 63; 16 Sweden, formally the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Nordic country located on the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe. 　It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge–tunnel across the Öresund. 　At 447,425 square kilometres (172,752 sq mi), Sweden is the largest Nordic country, the third-largest country in the European Union, and the fifth-largest country in Europe. 　The capital and largest city is Stockholm. 　Sweden has a total population of 10.5 million, and a low population density of 25.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (66/sq mi), with around 87% of Swedes residing in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area, in the central and southern half of the country. 　Nature in Sweden is dominated by forests and many lakes, including some of the largest in Europe. 　Many long rivers run from the Scandes range through the landscape, primarily emptying into the northern tributaries of the Baltic Sea. 　It has an extensive coastline and most of the population lives near a major body of water. 　With the country ranging from 55°N to 69°N, the climate of Sweden is diverse due to the length of the country. 　The usual conditions are mild for the latitudes with a maritime south, continental centre and subarctic north. 　Snow cover is variable in the densely populated south, but reliable in higher latitudes. 　Furthermore, the rain shadow of the Scandes results in quite dry winters and sunny summers in much of the country. 　Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Geats (Swedish: Götar) and Swedes (Svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen. 　An independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. 　After the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population, the dominance of the Hanseatic League in Northern Europe threatened Scandinavia economically and politically. 　This led to the forming of the Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397, which Sweden left in 1523. 　When Sweden became involved in the Thirty Years' War on the Protestant side, an expansion of its territories began, forming the Swedish Empire, which remained one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century. 　Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809. 　The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905. 　In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace, a longer span of peacetime than even Switzerland. 　Sweden maintained an official policy of neutrality during wartime and non-participation in military alliances during peacetime, although Sweden secretly relied on U.S. nuclear submarines during the Cold War. 　Sweden has since 2008 joined EU battlegroups, provided intelligence to NATO and since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO. 　Sweden is a highly developed country ranked seventh in the Human Development Index, it is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with legislative power vested in the 349-member unicameral Riksdag. 　It is a unitary state, currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities. 　Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens. 　It has the world's 12th highest GDP per capita and ranks very highly in quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, economic competitiveness, income equality, gender equality and prosperity. 　Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995 but rejected Eurozone membership following a referendum. 　It is also a member of the United Nations, the Nordic Council, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene>Gene</a> </h2>
<p>In biology, the word gene (from Greek: γένος, génos; meaning generation or birth or gender) can have several different meanings. 　The Mendelian gene is a basic unit of heredity and the molecular gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA that is transcribed to produce a functional RNA. 　There are two types of molecular genes: protein-coding genes and noncoding genes. 　During gene expression, the DNA is first copied into RNA. 　The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. 　The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. 　These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. 　Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. 　Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. 　Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or the number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, the risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life. 　Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. 　These alleles encode slightly different versions of a gene, which may cause different phenotypical traits. 　Usage of the term "having a gene" (e.g., "good genes," "hair color gene") typically refers to containing a different allele of the same, shared gene. 　Genes evolve due to natural selection / survival of the fittest and genetic drift of the alleles. 　The concept of gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. 　For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. 　Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. 　Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression. 　The term gene was introduced by Danish botanist, plant physiologist and geneticist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909. 　It is inspired by the Ancient Greek: γόνος, gonos, that means offspring and procreation.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric>Eric</a> </h2>
<p>The given name Eric, Erich, Erikk, Erik, Erick, or Eirik is derived from the Old Norse name Eiríkr [ˈɛiˌriːkz̠] (or Eríkr [ˈeˌriːkz̠] in Old East Norse due to monophthongization). 　The first element, ei- may be derived from the older Proto-Norse *aina(z), meaning "one, alone, unique", as in the form Æ∆inrikr explicitly, but it could also be from *aiwa(z) "everlasting, eternity", as in the Gothic form Euric. 　The second element -ríkr stems either from Proto-Germanic *ríks "king, ruler" (cf. Gothic reiks) or the therefrom derived *ríkijaz "kingly, powerful, rich, prince"; from the common Proto-Indo-European root *h₃rḗǵs. 　The name is thus usually taken to mean "sole ruler, autocrat" or "eternal ruler, ever powerful". 　Eric used in the sense of a proper noun meaning "one ruler" may be the origin of Eriksgata, and if so it would have meant "one ruler's journey". 　The tour was the medieval Swedish king's journey, when newly elected, to seek the acceptance of peripheral provinces. 　Eric is one of the most commonly used Germanic names in the United States, along with Robert, William, Edward and others. 　The most common spelling across Fennoscandia and in the Netherlands is Erik. 　In Norway, another form of the name (which has kept the Old Norse diphthong) Eirik is also commonly used. 　The modern Icelandic version is Eiríkur [ˈeiːˌriːkʏr̥], while the modern Faroese version is Eirikur. 　In Estonia and Finland (where Fenno-Swedish remains an official minority language), the standard Nordic name form Erik is found, but it may also be spelled phonetically as Eerik (Finnish: [ˈeːrik]), in accordance with Finnic language orthography, along with a slew of other unique Balto-Finnic variant forms including Eerikki, Eero, Erki and Erkki. 　Although the name was in use in Anglo-Saxon England, its use was reinforced by Scandinavian settlers arriving before the Norman conquest of England. 　It was an uncommon name in England until the Middle Ages, when it gained popularity, and finally became a common name in the 19th century. 　This was partly because of the publishing of the novel Eric, or, Little by Little by Frederic Farrar in 1858. 　The Latin form of the name is Euricus or Erīcus (Medieval Latin: [ɛˈriː.kus]), which was also adopted into Old Swedish usage (for example, cf. 15th century Kalmar Swedish historian Ericus Olai). 　Whence come the Greek forms Ερίκος (Eríkos) or Ερρίκος (Erríkos) (both pronounced [eˈri.kos]), in addition to the direct Nordic borrowing Έρικ (Érik). 　Éric (French: [e.ʁik]) is used in French, Erico or Errico in Italian, Érico in Portuguese. 　(Note some phonetically simplified modern forms may be conflated with descendants of cognate name Henry via Henrīcus, Henrik, from Proto-Germanic Haimarīks, sharing the stem *rīks.) 　Among Slavic languages, most using the Latin alphabet borrow Erik, but there also exists Polish Eryk. 　The name is adapted into Cyrillic as Russian Э́йрик (Éyrik) or Э́рик (Érik), and Ukrainian Е́рік (Érik). 　The Baltic languages use forms such as Latvian Ēriks and Lithuanian Erikas. 　And in Germany, Eric, Erik and Erich are used. 　In South America, the most common spelling is Erick. 　In Norway, Sweden and Finland, the name day for derivations of Erik and Eirik is 18 May, commemorating the death of Saint King Eric IX of Sweden, founder of the royal House of Eric. 　The feminine derivative is Erica or Erika.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency>Efficiency</a> </h2>
<p>Efficiency is the often measurable ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. 　In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste. 　In more mathematical or scientific terms, it signifies the level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. 　It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. 　Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries. 　In 2019, the European Commission said: "Resource efficiency means using the Earth's limited resources in a sustainable manner while minimising impacts on the environment. It allows us to create more with less and to deliver greater value with less input." 　Writer Deborah Stone notes that efficiency is "not a goal in itself. It is not something we want for its own sake, but rather because it helps us attain more of the things we value."</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt>Egypt</a> </h2>
<p>Egypt (Arabic: مصر Miṣr [mesˁr], Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mɑsˤr]), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. 　It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip of Palestine and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. 　The Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast separates Egypt from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. 　Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt, while Alexandria, the second-largest city, is an important industrial and tourist hub at the Mediterranean coast. 　At approximately 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the 14th-most populated country in the world. 　Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE. 　Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. 　Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest. 　Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which reflects its unique transcontinental location being simultaneously Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and North African. 　Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity, but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Sunni Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority, along with other lesser practiced faiths. 　Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained independence from the British Empire as a monarchy. 　Following the 1952 revolution, Egypt declared itself a republic, and in 1958 it merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic, which dissolved in 1961. 　Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Egypt endured social and religious strife and political instability, fighting several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and occupying the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967. 　In 1978, Egypt signed the Camp David Accords, officially withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and recognising Israel. 　After the Arab Spring, which led to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the country faced a protracted period of political unrest. 　Egypt's current government, a semi-presidential republic led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian or heading an authoritarian regime, responsible for perpetuating the country's poor human rights record. 　Islam is the official religion of Egypt and Arabic is its official language. 　With over 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arab world, the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fourteenth-most populous in the world. 　The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. 　The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. 　About 43% of Egypt's residents live across the country's urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta. 　Egypt is considered to be a regional power in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world, and a middle power worldwide. 　It is a developing country, ranking 97th on the Human Development Index. 　It has a diversified economy, which is the third-largest in Africa, the 33rd-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the 20th-largest globally by PPP. 　Egypt is a founding member of the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Arab League, the African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the World Youth Forum.</p>

<p>A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small. 　The term has several meanings. 　First, smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels; the Lady chapel is a common type of these. 　Second, a chapel is a place of worship, sometimes non-denominational, that is part of a building,complex or vessel with some other main purpose, such as a school, college, hospital, palace or large aristocratic house, castle, barracks, prison, funeral home, cemetery, airport, or a military or commercial ship. 　Third, chapels are small places of worship, built as satellite sites by a church or monastery, for example in remote areas; these are often called a chapel of ease. 　A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel. 　Finally, for historical reasons, chapel is also often the term used by independent or nonconformist denominations for their places of worship in Great Britain, even where they are large and in practice they operate as a parish church. 　The earliest Christian places of worship are now often referred to as chapels, as they were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building. 　Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars which, if they occupied a distinct space, would often be called a chapel. 　In Russian Orthodox tradition, the chapels were built underneath city gates, where most people could visit them. 　The most famous example is the Iberian Chapel. 　Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship, they are also commonly found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily denote a specific denomination. 　In England—where the Church of England is established by law—non-denominational or inter-faith chapels in such institutions may nonetheless be consecrated by the local Anglican bishop. 　Non-denominational chapels are commonly encountered as part of a non-religious institution such as a hospital, airport, university or prison. 　Many military installations have chapels for the use of military personnel, normally under the leadership of a military chaplain.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein>Protein</a> </h2>
<p>Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. 　Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. 　Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity. 　A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. 　A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. 　Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides. 　The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. 　The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. 　In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; but in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. 　Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. 　Some proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. 　Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes. 　Once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. 　A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. 　They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. 　Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable. 　Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. 　Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. 　Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. 　Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. 　In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. 　Digestion breaks the proteins down for metabolic use. 　Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. 　Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment>Investment</a> </h2>
<p>Investment is the dedication of money to purchase of an asset to attain an increase in value over a period of time. 　Investment requires a sacrifice of some present asset, such as time, money, or effort. 　In finance, the purpose of investing is to generate a return from the invested asset. 　The return may consist of a gain (profit) or a loss realized from the sale of a property or an investment, unrealized capital appreciation (or depreciation), or investment income such as dividends, interest, or rental income, or a combination of capital gain and income. 　The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. 　Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. 　When a low-risk investment is made, the return is also generally low. 　Similarly, high risk comes with a chance of high losses. 　Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to diversify their portfolio. 　Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname>Surname</a> </h2>
<p>In some cultures, a surname, family name, or last name is the portion of one's personal name that indicates one's family, tribe or community. 　Practices vary by culture. 　The family name may be placed at either the start of a person's full name, as the forename, or at the end; the number of surnames given to an individual also varies. 　As the surname can indicate genetic inheritance,[citation needed] all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations; for example, a woman might marry and have a child, but later remarry and have another child by a different father, and as such both children could have different surnames. 　It is common to see two or more words in a surname, such as in compound surnames. 　Compound surnames can be composed of separate names, such as in traditional Spanish culture, they can be hyphenated together, or may contain prefixes. 　Using names has been documented in even the oldest historical records. 　Examples of surnames are documented in the 11th century by the barons in England. 　English surnames began as a way of identifying a certain aspect of that individual, such as by trade, father's name, location of birth, or physical features, and were not necessarily inherited. 　By 1400 most English families, and those from Lowland Scotland, had adopted the use of hereditary surnames.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding>Funding</a> </h2>
<p>Funding is the act of providing resources to finance a need, program, or project. 　While this is usually in the form of money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an organization or company. 　Generally, this word is used when a firm uses its internal reserves to satisfy its necessity for cash, while the term financing is used when the firm acquires capital from external sources.　[citation needed] Sources of funding include credit, venture capital, donations, grants, savings, subsidies, and taxes. 　Fundings such as donations, subsidies, and grants that have no direct requirement for return of investment are described as "soft funding" or "crowdfunding". 　Funding that facilitates the exchange of equity ownership in a company for capital investment via an online funding portal per the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (alternately, the "JOBS Act of 2012") (U.S.) is known as equity crowdfunding. 　Funds can be allocated for either short-term or long-term purposes.</p>
