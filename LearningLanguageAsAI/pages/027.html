<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence>Intelligence</a> </h2>
<p>Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. 　More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. 　Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence. 　Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refused>Refused</a> </h2>
<p>Refused (also known as the Refused) is a Swedish hardcore punk band originating from Umeå and formed in 1991. 　Refused is composed of vocalist Dennis Lyxzén, guitarist Kristofer Steen, drummer David Sandström, and bassist Magnus Flagge. 　Guitarist Jon Brännström was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. 　Their lyrics are often of a non-conformist and politically far-left nature and were for a time associated with the straight edge subculture. 　The band released their debut album This Just Might Be... the Truth in 1994. 　They followed this up with Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent (1996) and five EPs. 　In 1998, the band released The Shape of Punk to Come, which expanded their sound with jazz and electronic influences, but was initially poorly received commercially and critically. 　The group shortly after disbanded during their subsequent tour. 　Despite limited contemporary success, Refused were influential on the development of rock music in subsequent decades. 　In 2012, the band reformed and commenced a reunion tour, and later released further albums Freedom (2015) and War Music (2019).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat>Throat</a> </h2>
<p>In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the front part of the neck, internally positioned in front of the vertebrae. 　It contains the pharynx and larynx. 　An important section of it is the epiglottis, separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe), preventing food and drinks being inhaled into the lungs. 　The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords. 　Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. 　The "throat" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces. 　It works with the mouth, ears and nose, as well as a number of other parts of the body. 　Its pharynx is connected to the mouth, allowing speech to occur, and food and liquid to pass down the throat. 　It is joined to the nose by the nasopharynx at the top of the throat, and to the ear by its Eustachian tube. 　The throat's trachea carries inhaled air to the bronchi of the lungs. 　The esophagus carries food through the throat to the stomach. 　Adenoids and tonsils help prevent infection and are composed of lymph tissue. 　The larynx contains vocal cords, the epiglottis (preventing food/liquid inhalation), and an area known as the subglottic larynx, in children it is the narrowest section of the upper part of the throat. 　The Jugulum is a low part of the throat, located slightly above the breast. 　The term Jugulum is reflected both by the internal and external jugular veins, which pass through the Jugulum.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey>Hockey</a> </h2>
<p>Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. 　While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel and, notably, playing surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal. 　There are many types of hockey. 　Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. 　In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey". 　In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. 　Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a "puck") with a hole in the center instead. 　The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. 　The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. 　The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963. 　Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936. 　Certain sports which share general characteristics with the forms of hockey, but are not generally referred to as hockey include Lacrosse, Hurling, Camogie and Shinty.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing>Racing</a> </h2>
<p>In sport, racing is a competition of speed, in which competitors try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. 　Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. 　A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made up of several segments called heats, stages or legs. 　A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. 　A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial. 　Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, which depicted running men vying for first place. 　A chariot race is described in Homer's Iliad.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics>Physics</a> </h2>
<p>Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. 　Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves. 　A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist. 　Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. 　Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. 　Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. 　New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy. 　Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. 　For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain>Brain</a> </h2>
<p>A brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. 　It is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. 　It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. 　In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion. 　Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. 　These neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. 　Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs. 　They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. 　This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. 　Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. 　The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved. 　Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. 　This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. 　It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. 　The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. 　Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. 　The most important that are covered in the human brain article are brain disease and the effects of brain damage.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal>Animal</a> </h2>
<p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. 　With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. 　Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. 　Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). 　They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. 　The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. 　Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. 　The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. 　Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. 　Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 　6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago. 　Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. 　Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. 　In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. 　In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa. 　Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. 　Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. 　Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm>Storm</a> </h2>
<p>A storm is any disturbed state of the natural environment or the atmosphere of an astronomical body.　[citation needed] It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, tornadoes, hail, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy precipitation (snowstorm, rainstorm), heavy freezing rain (ice storm), strong winds (tropical cyclone, windstorm), wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as in a dust storm, among other forms of severe weather. 　Storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge, heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility, lightning, wildfires, and vertical and horizontal wind shear. 　Systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through. 　Heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise, such as skiing and snowmobiling. 　The English word comes from Proto-Germanic *sturmaz meaning "noise, tumult". 　Storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with the system of high pressure surrounding it. 　This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as cumulonimbus. 　Small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine>Medicine</a> </h2>
<p>Medicine is the science and practice of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. 　Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. 　Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. 　Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. 　For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. 　In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). 　For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. 　Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine, and are thus called alternative medicine. 　Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean>Ocean</a> </h2>
<p>The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. 　An ocean can also refer to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided. 　Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest). 　Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. 　The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. 　Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. 　Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. 　The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. 　The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. 　The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. 　This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. 　Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. 　Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. 　This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. 　Light penetrates to a depth of only a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. 　The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. 　Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. 　Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. 　In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). 　Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). 　Deep ocean temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean. 　Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents. 　These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity. 　Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves. 　Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 　Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe. 　This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean. 　Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. 　This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water. 　The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification. 　The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation. 　It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to food and other resources. 　Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species. 　However, the ocean is subject to numerous human-caused environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, and effects of climate change on oceans, such as ocean warming, ocean acidification, sea level rise and many more. 　The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting>Painting</a> </h2>
<p>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"[citation needed] or "support"). 　The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. 　In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a painting"). 　The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects. 　Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture (as in gestural painting), narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction (as in abstract art). 　Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism). 　A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. 　Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke>Duke</a> </h2>
<p>Duke is a male title either of a monarch ruling over a duchy, or of a member of royalty, or nobility. 　As rulers, dukes are ranked below emperors, kings, grand princes, grand dukes, and sovereign princes. 　As royalty or nobility, they are ranked below princes and grand dukes. 　The title comes from French duc, itself from the Latin dux, 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province. 　In most countries, the word duchess is the female equivalent. 　Following the reforms of the emperor Diocletian (which separated the civilian and military administrations of the Roman provinces), a dux became the military commander in each province. 　The title dux, Hellenised to doux, survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it continued in several contexts, signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general. 　Later on, in the 11th century, the title Megas Doux was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy. 　During the Middle Ages the title (as Herzog) signified first among the Germanic monarchies. 　Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king. 　A duke may or may not be, ipso facto, a member of the nation's peerage: in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in France some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g. Grandeeship, Imperial Diet, Hungarian House of Magnates) existed. 　During the 19th century, many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by dukes or grand dukes. 　But at present, with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there are no dukes ruling as monarchs. 　Duke remains the highest hereditary title (aside from titles borne by a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty) in Portugal (though now a republic), Spain, and the United Kingdom. 　In Sweden, members of the Royal Family are given a personal dukedom at birth. 　The Pope, as a temporal sovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of duke or duchess to persons for services to the Holy See. 　In some realms the relative status of "duke" and "prince", as titles borne by the nobility rather than by members of reigning dynasties, varied—e.g., in Italy and Germany. 　A woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is married to a duke, is normally styled duchess. 　Queen Elizabeth II, however, was known by tradition as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of Lancaster in Lancashire.</p>

<p>A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. 　The word is derived from the Latin name palātium, for Palatine Hill in Rome which housed the Imperial residences. 　Most European languages have a version of the term (palais, palazzo, palacio, etc.), and many use it for a wider range of buildings than English. 　In many parts of Europe, the equivalent term is also applied to large private houses in cities, especially of the aristocracy; often the term for a large country house is different. 　Many historic palaces are now put to other uses such as parliaments, museums, hotels, or office buildings. 　The word is also sometimes used to describe a lavishly ornate building used for public entertainment or exhibitions such as a movie palace. 　A palace is distinguished from a castle while the latter clearly is fortified or has the style of a fortification, whereas a palace does not.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice>Nice</a> </h2>
<p>Nice (/niːs/ NEESS, French pronunciation: [nis] (listen); Niçard: Niça, classical norm, or Nissa, nonstandard, pronounced [ˈnisa]; Italian: Nizza [ˈnittsa]; Ligurian: Nissa; Ancient Greek: Νίκαια; Latin: Nicaea) is the prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department in France. 　The Nice agglomeration extends far beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of nearly 1 million on an area of 744 km2 (287 sq mi). 　Located on the French Riviera, the southeastern coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the French Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. 　Nice is approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) from the principality of Monaco and 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the French–Italian border. 　Nice's airport serves as a gateway to the region. 　The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella in Niçard), meaning 'Nice the Beautiful', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by Menica Rondelly in 1912. 　The area of today's Nice contains Terra Amata, an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. 　Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Νίκαια, Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory. 　Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. 　Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. 　From 1388 it was a dominion of Savoy, then became part of the French First Republic between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the legal predecessor of the Kingdom of Italy, until its re-annexation by France in 1860. 　The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. 　In 1931, following its refurbishment the city's main seaside promenade, the Promenade des Anglais ("Walkway of the English"), was inaugurated by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught; it owes its name to visitors to the resort. 　These included Queen Victoria along with her son Edward VII who spent winters there, as well as Henry Cavendish, born in Nice, who discovered hydrogen. 　The clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Arman. 　Their work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, including Musée Marc Chagall, Musée Matisse and Musée des Beaux-Arts. 　International writers have also been attracted and inspired by the city. 　Frank Harris wrote several books including his autobiography My Life and Loves in Nice. 　Friedrich Nietzsche spent six consecutive winters in Nice, and wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra here. 　Additionally, Russian writer Anton Chekhov completed his play Three Sisters while living in Nice. 　Nice's appeal extended to the Russian upper classes. 　Prince Nicholas Alexandrovich, heir apparent to Imperial Russia, died in Nice and was a patron of the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice where Princess Catherine Dolgorukova, morganatic wife of the Tsar Alexander II of Russia, is buried. 　Also buried there are General Dmitry Shcherbachev and General Nikolai Yudenich, leaders of the anti-Communist White Movement. 　Those interred at the Cimetière du Château include celebrated jeweler Alfred Van Cleef, Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, founder of the Mercedes car company, film director Louis Feuillade, poet Agathe-Sophie Sasserno, dancer Carolina Otero, Asterix comics creator René Goscinny, The Phantom of the Opera author Gaston Leroux, French prime minister Léon Gambetta, and the first president of the International Court of Justice José Gustavo Guerrero. 　Because of its historical importance as a winter resort town for the European aristocracy and the resulting mix of cultures found in the city, UNESCO proclaimed Nice a World Heritage Site in 2021. 　The city has the second largest hotel capacity in the country, and it is the second most visited metropolis in the hexagon, receiving 4 million tourists every year. 　It also has the third busiest airport in France, after the two main Parisian ones. 　It is the historical capital city of the County of Nice (French: Comté de Nice, Niçard: Countèa de Nissa).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel>Steel</a> </h2>
<p>Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with improved strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. 　Many other elements may be present or added. 　Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium. 　Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, machines, electrical appliances, and weapons. 　Iron is the base metal of steel. 　Depending on the temperature, it can take two crystalline forms (allotropic forms): body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic. 　The interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. 　In pure iron, the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile, or soft and easily formed. 　In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations. 　The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight. 　Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), impedes the movement of the dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. 　These qualities include the hardness, quenching behaviour, need for annealing, tempering behaviour, yield strength, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. 　The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility. 　Steel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast furnace and production of crucible steel. 　This was followed by the open-hearth furnace and then the Bessemer process in England in the mid-19th century. 　With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced steel began. 　Mild steel replaced wrought iron. 　The German states saw major steel prowess over Europe in the 19th century. 　Further refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product. 　Today, steel is one of the most commonly manufactured materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. 　Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organisations. 　The modern steel industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the world, but is one of the most energy and greenhouse gas emission intense industries, contributing 8% of global emissions. 　However, steel is also very reusable: it is one of the world's most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of over 60% globally.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus>Bus</a> </h2>
<p>A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a road vehicle that carries significantly more passengers than an average car or van. 　It is most commonly used in public transport, but is also in use for charter purposes, or through private ownership. 　Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers, some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers. 　The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. 　Coaches are used for longer-distance services. 　Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. 　Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. 　In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence. 　Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles. 　Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882. 　The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895. 　Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel. 　As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat>Boat</a> </h2>
<p>A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. 　Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. 　However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. 　In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. 　Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. 　Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. 　Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. 　Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats. 　House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. 　Lighters are used to move cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. 　Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions. 　Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. rowboats and paddle boats), wind (e.g. sailboats), and inboard/outboard motors (including gasoline, diesel, and electric).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome>Rome</a> </h2>
<p>Rome City Centre Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] (listen)) is the capital city of Italy. 　It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. 　With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. 　The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. 　Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. 　Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. 　Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. 　Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the "Eternal City". 　Rome is generally considered to be the "cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture", and the centre of the Catholic Church. 　Rome's history spans 28 centuries. 　While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. 　The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. 　Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis. 　It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La Città Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. 　Rome is also called "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World). 　After the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. 　Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world. 　In this way, Rome became first one of the major centres of the Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. 　Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. 　In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic. 　In 2019, Rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy. 　Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. 　The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 　The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many international businesses, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo, and banks such as BNL. 　Numerous companies are based within Rome's EUR business district, such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. 　The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.</p>
