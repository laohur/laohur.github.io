<p>A cave or cavern is a natural void in the ground, specifically a space large enough for a human to enter. 　Caves often form by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground. 　The word cave can refer to smaller openings such as sea caves, rock shelters, and grottos, that extend a relatively short distance into the rock and they are called exogene caves. 　Caves which extend further underground than the opening is wide are called endogene caves. 　Speleology is the science of exploration and study of all aspects of caves and the cave environment. 　Visiting or exploring caves for recreation may be called caving, potholing, or spelunking.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement>Measurement</a> </h2>
<p>Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events. 　In other words, measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind. 　The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. 　In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. 　However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioural sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales. 　Measurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology and quantitative research in many disciplines. 　Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. 　Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. 　Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). 　This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. 　The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology. 　Measurement is defined as the process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a known or standard quantity.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign>Reign</a> </h2>
<p>A reign is the period of a person's or dynasty's occupation of the office of monarch of a nation (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Andorra), of a people (e.g., the Franks, the Zulus) or of a spiritual community (e.g., Catholicism, Tibetan Buddhism, Nizari Ismailism). 　In most hereditary monarchies and some elective monarchies (e.g., Holy Roman Empire) there have been no limits on the duration of a sovereign's reign or incumbency, nor is there a term of office. 　Thus, a reign usually lasts until the monarch dies, unless the monarchy itself is abolished or the monarch abdicates or is deposed. 　In elective monarchies, there may be a fixed period of time for the duration of the monarch's tenure in office (e.g., Malaysia). 　The term of a reign can be indicated with the abbreviation "r." (for Latin rexit) after a sovereign's name, such as the following: George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, Emperor of India (r. 1936–1952)</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland>Switzerland</a> </h2>
<p>Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country located at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe. 　It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. 　Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas the Swiss population of approximately 8.7 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are located, including Zürich, Geneva and Basel. 　Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle Ages following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy. 　The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. 　Since the Reformation of the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality. 　Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. 　Switzerland has not fought an international war since 1815. 　It joined the United Nations only in 2002, though it pursues an active foreign policy, including participation in frequent peace-building processes worldwide. 　Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and best-known humanitarian organisations, and hosts the headquarters or offices of most major international institutions, including the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, FIFA, and the United Nations. 　It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but not part of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area, or the Eurozone; however, it participates in the European single market and the Schengen Area through bilateral treaties. 　Switzerland is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern. 　It has four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. 　Although most Swiss are German-speaking, national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine symbolism. 　This identity transcends language, ethnicity, and religion, leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnationcode: deu promoted to code: de ("nation of volition") rather than a nation state. 　Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by multiple native names: Schweizcode: deu promoted to code: de [ˈʃvaɪts] (German); Suisse [sɥis(ə)] audio (help·info) (French); Svizzeracode: ita promoted to code: it [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizracode: roh promoted to code: rm [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh). 　On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helveticacode: lat promoted to code: la — frequently shortened to "Helvetia" — is used instead of the spoken languages. 　Switzerland is one of the world's most developed countries. 　It has the highest nominal wealth per adult of any country and the eighth-highest gross domestic product per capita. 　Switzerland ranks first in the Human Development Index since 2021 and performs highly also on several international metrics, including economic competitiveness and democratic governance. 　Cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in terms of quality of life, albeit with some of the highest costs of living.</p>

<p>A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of surface water or underground streams. 　Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. 　Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. 　A dam can also be used to collect or store water which can be evenly distributed between locations. 　Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. 　The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan, dating to 3,000 BC. 　The word dam can be traced back to Middle English, and before that, from Middle Dutch, as seen in the names of many old cities, such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam.</p>

<p>Greece, officially the Hellenic Republic, is a country in Southeast Europe. 　It is situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, and is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. 　Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast. 　The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. 　Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, featuring thousands of islands. 　The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.4 million. 　Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras. 　Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. 　From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. 　Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to the North Western parts of India. 　The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. 　Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. 　The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. 　After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. 　The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　Greece is a unitary parliamentary republic, and a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy, and a high quality of life, ranking 32nd in the Human Development Index. 　Its economy is among the largest in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. 　A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. 　It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, NATO, the OECD, the WTO, and the OSCE. 　Greece has a unique cultural heritage, large tourism industry, and prominent shipping sector.</p>

<p>Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. 　These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory, algebra, geometry, and analysis, respectively. 　There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline. 　Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them. 　These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. 　A proof consists of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. 　These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration. 　Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social sciences. 　Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. 　Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. 　Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical applications. 　The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks. 　Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. 　Since its beginning, mathematics was essentially divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new areas. 　Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a rapid lockstep increase in the development of both. 　At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. 　The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_(biology)>Tribe (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>In biology, a tribe is a taxonomic rank above genus, but below family and subfamily. 　It is sometimes subdivided into subtribes. 　By convention, all taxonomic ranks from genus upwards are capitalized, including both tribe and subtribe. 　In zoology, the standard ending for the name of a zoological tribe is "-ini". 　Examples include the tribes Caprini (goat-antelopes), Hominini (hominins), Bombini (bumblebees), and Thunnini (tunas). 　The tribe Hominini is divided into subtribes by some scientists; subtribe Hominina then comprises "humans". 　The standard ending for the name of a zoological subtribe is "-ina". 　In botany, the standard ending for the name of a botanical tribe is "-eae". 　Examples include the tribes Acalypheae and Hyacintheae. 　The tribe Hyacintheae is divided into subtribes, including the subtribe Massoniinae. 　The standard ending for the name of a botanical subtribe is "-inae". 　In bacteriology, the form of tribe names is as in botany, e.g., Pseudomonadeae, based on the genus name Pseudomonas.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe>Tribe</a> </h2>
<p>The term tribe is used in many different contexts to refer to a category of human social group. 　The predominant worldwide usage of the term in English is in the discipline of anthropology. 　Its definition is contested, in part due to conflicting theoretical understandings of social and kinship structures, and also reflecting the problematic application of this concept to extremely diverse human societies. 　The concept is often contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, being hierarchically larger than a lineage or clan, but smaller than a chiefdom, nation or state. 　These terms are equally disputed. 　In some cases tribes have legal recognition and some degree of political autonomy from national or federal government, but this legalistic usage of the term may conflict with anthropological definitions. 　In the United States, Native American tribes are legally considered to have "domestic dependent nation" status within the territorial United States, with a government-to-government relationship with the federal government.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape>Landscape</a> </h2>
<p>A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms, and how they integrate with natural or man-made features, often considered in terms of their aesthetic appeal. 　A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains, hills, water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation, human elements including different forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions. 　Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity. 　The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. 　It is the dynamic backdrop to people's lives. 　Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a landscape park or wilderness. 　The Earth has a vast range of landscapes including the icy landscapes of polar regions, mountainous landscapes, vast arid desert landscapes, islands, and coastal landscapes, densely forested or wooded landscapes including past boreal forests and tropical rainforests and agricultural landscapes of temperate and tropical regions. 　The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as landscaping.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth>Commonwealth</a> </h2>
<p>A commonwealth is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good. 　Historically, it has been synonymous with "republic". 　The noun "commonwealth", meaning "public welfare, general good or advantage", dates from the 15th century. 　Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common wealth – echoed in the modern synonym "public wealth"), it comes from the old meaning of "wealth", which is "well-being", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin res publica (republic). 　The term literally meant "common well-being". 　In the 17th century, the definition of "commonwealth" expanded from its original sense of "public welfare" or "commonweal" to mean "a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state". 　The term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities. 　Three countries – Australia, the Bahamas, and Dominica – have the official title "Commonwealth", as do four U.S. states and two U.S. territories. 　Since the early 20th century, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of states, most notably the Commonwealth of Nations, an organisation primarily of former territories of the British Empire. 　The organisation is not to be confused with the realms of the Commonwealth.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing>Manufacturing</a> </h2>
<p>Manufacturing is the creation or production of goods with the help of equipment, labor, machines, tools, and chemical or biological processing or formulation. 　It is the essence of the secondary sector of the economy. 　The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high-tech, but it is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from the primary sector are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. 　Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers). 　Manufacturing engineering is the field of engineering that designs and optimizes the manufacturing process, or the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. 　The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification. 　These materials are then modified through manufacturing to become the desired product. 　Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes involved in the production and integration of a product's components. 　Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers, use the term fabrication instead. 　The manufacturing sector is closely connected with the engineering and industrial design industries.</p>
