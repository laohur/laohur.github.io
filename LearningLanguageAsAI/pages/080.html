<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy>Conspiracy</a> </h2>
<p>A conspiracy, also known as a plot, is a secret plan or agreement between people (called conspirers or conspirators) for an unlawful or harmful purpose, such as murder or treason, especially with political motivation, while keeping their agreement secret from the public or from other people affected by it. 　In a political sense, conspiracy refers to a group of people united in the goal of usurping, altering or overthrowing an established political power. 　Depending on the circumstances, a conspiracy may also be a crime, or a civil wrong. 　The term generally implies wrongdoing or illegality on the part of the conspirators, as people would not need to conspire to engage in activities that were lawful and ethical, or to which no one would object. 　There are some coordinated activities that people engage in with secrecy that are not generally thought of as conspiracies. 　For example, intelligence agencies such as the American CIA and the British MI6 necessarily make plans in secret to spy on suspected enemies of their respective countries, but this kind of activity is generally not considered to be a conspiracy so long as their goal is to fulfill their official functions, and not something like improperly enriching themselves. 　Similarly, the coaches of competing sports teams routinely meet behind closed doors to plan game strategies and specific plays designed to defeat their opponents, but this activity is not considered a conspiracy because this is considered a legitimate part of the sport. 　Furthermore, a conspiracy must be engaged in knowingly. 　The continuation of social traditions that work to the advantage of certain groups and to the disadvantage of certain other groups, though possibly unethical, is not a conspiracy if participants in the practice are not carrying it forward for the purpose of perpetuating this advantage. 　On the other hand, if the intent of carrying out a conspiracy exists, then there is a conspiracy even if the details are never agreed to aloud by the participants. 　CIA covert operations, for instance, are by their very nature hard to prove definitively but research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has suggested several cases where the agency tried to influence events. 　During the Cold War, the United States tried to covertly change other nations' governments 66 times, succeeding in 26 cases. 　A "conspiracy theory" is a belief that a conspiracy has actually been decisive in producing a political event of which the theorists strongly disapprove. 　Political scientist Michael Barkun has described conspiracy theories as relying on the view that the universe is governed by design, and embody three principles: nothing happens by accident, nothing is as it seems, and everything is connected. 　Another common feature is that conspiracy theories evolve to incorporate whatever evidence exists against them, so that they become, as Barkun writes, a closed system that is unfalsifiable, and therefore "a matter of faith rather than proof."</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome>Dome</a> </h2>
<p>A dome (from Latin domus) is an architectural element similar to the hollow upper half of a sphere. 　There is significant overlap with the term cupola, which may also refer to a dome or a structure on top of a dome. 　The precise definition of a dome has been a matter of controversy and there are a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them. 　A dome can rest directly upon a rotunda wall, a drum, or a system of squinches or pendentives used to accommodate the transition in shape from a rectangular or square space to the round or polygonal base of the dome. 　The dome's apex may be closed or may be open in the form of an oculus, which may itself be covered with a roof lantern and cupola. 　Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into prehistory. 　Domes were built in ancient Mesopotamia, and they have been found in Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Chinese architecture in the ancient world, as well as among a number of indigenous building traditions throughout the world. 　Dome structures were common in both Byzantine architecture and Sasanian architecture, which influenced that of the rest of Europe and Islam, respectively, in the Middle Ages. 　The domes of European Renaissance architecture spread from Italy in the early modern period, while domes were frequently employed in Ottoman architecture at the same time. 　Baroque and Neoclassical architecture took inspiration from Roman domes. 　Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques resulted in new dome types. 　Domes have been constructed over the centuries from mud, snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and plastic. 　The symbolism associated with domes includes mortuary, celestial, and governmental traditions that have likewise altered over time. 　The domes of the modern world can be found over religious buildings, legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_(geology)>Dome (geology)</a> </h2>
<p>A dome is a feature in structural geology consisting of symmetrical anticlines that intersect each other at their respective apices. 　Intact, domes are distinct, rounded, spherical-to-ellipsoidal-shaped protrusions on the Earth's surface. 　However, a transect parallel to Earth's surface of a dome features concentric rings of strata. 　Consequently, if the top of a dome has been eroded flat, the resulting structure in plan view appears as a bullseye, with the youngest rock layers at the outside, and each ring growing progressively older moving inwards. 　These strata would have been horizontal at the time of deposition, then later deformed by the uplift associated with dome formation.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond>Raymond</a> </h2>
<p>Raymond is a male given name. 　It was borrowed into English from French (older French spellings were Reimund and Raimund, whereas the modern English and French spellings are identical). 　It originated as the Germanic ᚱᚨᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (Raginmund) or ᚱᛖᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (Reginmund). 　Ragin (Gothic) and regin (Old German) meant "counsel". 　The Old High German mund originally meant "hand", but came to mean "protection". 　This etymology suggests that the name originated in the Early Middle Ages, possibly from Latin. 　Alternatively, the name can also be derived from Germanic Hraidmund, the first element being Hraid, possibly meaning "fame" (compare Hrod, found in names such as Robert, Roderick, Rudolph, Roland, Rodney and Roger) and mund meaning "protector". 　Despite the German and French origins of the English name, some of its early uses in English documents appear in Latinized form. 　As a surname, its first recorded appearance in Britain appeared in 1086, during the reign of William the Conqueror, in the Domesday Book, with a reference to Giraldus Reimundus. 　The most commonly used names for baby boys based on "Ragin" in 2009 were, in descending order, Raymond, Ramiro, Rayner, Rein, Reingard, Reynard, and Reynold. 　Its many other variants include Raiment, Raimo, Raimond, Raimondi, Raimondo, Raimund, Raimundo, Ramon, Ramón, Ramond, Ramondelli, Ramondenc, Ramondi, Ramondini, Ramondino, Ramondo, Ramondou, Ramonenc, Ramonic, Ramundi, Rayment, Raymonenc, Raymonencq, Raymont, Raymund, Redmond, Redmonds, Reim, Reimund, Reinmund, Rémon, Rémond, Remondeau, Remondon, Rémont, Reymond, Rimondi, and Rimondini.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard>Leonard</a> </h2>
<p>Leonard or Leo is a common English masculine given name and a surname. 　The given name and surname originate from the Old High German Leonhard containing the prefix levon ("lion") from the Greek Λέων ("lion") through the Latin Leo, and the suffix hardu ("brave" or "hardy"). 　The name has come to mean "lion strength", "lion-strong", or "lion-hearted". 　Leonard was the name of a Saint in the Middle Ages period, known as the patron saint of prisoners. 　Leonard is also an Irish origin surname, from the Gaelic O'Leannain also found as O'Leonard, but often was anglicised to just Leonard, consisting of the prefix O ("descendant of") and the suffix Leannan ("lover"). 　The oldest public records of the surname appear in 1272 in Huntingdonshire, England, and in 1479 in Ulm, Germany.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate>Chocolate</a> </h2>
<p>Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. 　Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people ─ including the Maya and Aztecs ─ made chocolate beverages. 　The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. 　After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. 　The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. 　Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. 　The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. 　Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. 　Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. 　Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. 　Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. 　White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. 　Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. 　Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. 　Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. 　Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. 　Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao. 　Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply. 　With some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns. 　A 2018 report argued that international attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw>Warsaw</a> </h2>
<p>Warsaw (Polish: Warszawa, [varˈʂava] (listen)), officially the Capital City of Warsaw, is the capital and largest city of Poland. 　The metropolis stands on the River Vistula in east-central Poland, and its population is officially estimated at 1.86 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3.1 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 6th most-populous city in the European Union. 　The city area measures 517 km2 (200 sq mi) and comprises 18 districts, while the metropolitan area covers 6,100 km2 (2,355 sq mi). 　Warsaw is an Alpha global city, a major cultural, political and economic hub, and the country's seat of government. 　Warsaw traces its origins to a small fishing town in Masovia. 　The city rose to prominence in the late 16th century, when Sigismund III decided to move the Polish capital and his royal court from Kraków. 　Warsaw served as the de facto capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795, and subsequently as the seat of Napoleon's Duchy of Warsaw. 　The 19th century and its Industrial Revolution brought a demographic boom which made it one of the largest and most densely populated cities in Europe. 　Known then for its elegant architecture and boulevards, Warsaw was bombed and besieged at the start of World War II in 1939. 　Much of the historic city was destroyed and its diverse population decimated by the Ghetto Uprising in 1943, the general Warsaw Uprising in 1944 and systematic razing. 　Warsaw is served by two international airports, the busiest being Warsaw Chopin and the smaller Warsaw Modlin intended for low-cost carriers. 　Major public transport services operating in the city include the Warsaw Metro, buses, commuter rail service and an extensive tram network. 　The city is a significant centre of research and development, business process outsourcing, and information technology outsourcing. 　The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe. 　Frontex, the European Union agency for external border security, and ODIHR, one of the principal institutions of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, have their headquarters in Warsaw. 　As of 2022, Warsaw has one of the highest number of skyscrapers in Europe while Varso Place is the tallest building in the European Union. 　The city is home to renowned universities such as the University of Warsaw, the Warsaw University of Technology, SGH Warsaw School of Economics, Chopin University of Music and Kozminski University. 　It also hosts the Polish Academy of Sciences, National Philharmonic Orchestra, the National Museum, Zachęta Art Gallery and the Warsaw Grand Theatre, the largest of its kind in the world. 　The reconstructed Old Town, which represents examples of nearly every European architectural style and historical period, was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1980. 　Other architectural attractions include the Royal Castle, Sigismund's Column, the Wilanów Palace, the Palace on the Isle, St. John's Archcathedral, Main Market Square, and numerous churches and mansions along the Royal Route. 　The Warsaw Zoo is among the largest and most-visited zoological gardens in the country. 　The city possesses thriving arts and club scenes, gourmet restaurants and large urban green spaces, with around a quarter of the city's area occupied by parks. 　In sports, the city is known as the home of the top-tier football club Legia Warsaw, the Warsaw Marathon and Poland's national football stadium Stadion Narodowy.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud>Fraud</a> </h2>
<p>In law, fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. 　Fraud can violate civil law (e.g., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud or recover monetary compensation) or criminal law (e.g., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities), or it may cause no loss of money, property, or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. 　The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, for example by obtaining a passport, travel document, or driver's license, or mortgage fraud, where the perpetrator may attempt to qualify for a mortgage by way of false statements. 　Internal fraud, also known as "insider fraud", is fraud committed or attempted by someone within an organisation such as an employee. 　A hoax is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_(Irish mythology)>Oscar (Irish mythology)</a> </h2>
<p>Oscar (oscara = "deer/god friend") is a figure in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. 　He is the son of Oisín (the son of the epic hero Fionn mac Cumhail) and Niamh, and the brother of Plor na mBan, his bride is called Malvina. 　Though possibly a later addition to the cycle, Oscar was a popular character, and appeared prominently in several later Fenian tales, serving his grandfather as one of the fianna. 　In Bruidhean Chaorthainn (Fairy Palace of the Quicken Trees), Oscar swept off the head of Sinsar, the King of the World, in the battle on the ford of the Shannon River. 　His death is described in the story Cath Gabhra (The Battle of Gabhra), which pits the increasingly corrupt Fianna against the Army of the High King of Ireland, Cairbre Lifechair. 　Cairbre, aided by defected Fianna warriors loyal to Goll mac Morna, receives his death blow from Oscar, but mortally wounds him with his steel chains as his final act. 　Oscar's death causes Fionn to weep for the only time in his life, and serves as the final blow to the Fianna's strength.</p>

<p>Devon (/ˈdɛvən/ DEV-ən, also historically known as Devonshire /ˈdɛvənʃɪər, -ʃər/ DEV-ən-sheer, -⁠shər) is a ceremonial, non-metropolitan, and historic county in South West England. 　Devon is coastal with a variety of cliffs and sandy beaches. 　It has the largest open space in southern England, Dartmoor National Park. 　A predominately rural county, Devon has a relatively low population density for a county in England. 　Its most populous settlement is the City of Plymouth. 　The county town of Devon, the City of Exeter, is the second most populous settlement. 　The county is bordered by Somerset to the north east, Dorset to the east, and Cornwall to the west. 　Its economy is heavily orientated around the tourism and agriculture industries. 　Devon is administratively split into the non-metropolitan districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, West Devon, Exeter, and two unitary authority areas of Plymouth, and Torbay. 　Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is 6,707 km2 (2,590 square miles) and its population is about 1.2 million. 　The county derives its name from Dumnonia (the shift from m to v is a typical Celtic consonant shift). 　During the British Iron Age, Roman Britain and the early Middle Ages, this was the homeland of the Dumnonii Brittonic Celts. 　The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of Wessex during the eighth and ninth centuries. 　The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the River Tamar by King Æthelstan in 936. 　Devon was later constituted as a shire of the Kingdom of England.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier>Frontier</a> </h2>
<p>A frontier is the political and geographical area near or beyond a boundary. 　A frontier can also be referred to as a "front". 　The term came from French in the 15th century, with the meaning "borderland"—the region of a country that fronts on another country (see also marches). 　Unlike a border—a rigid and clear-cut form of state boundary—in the most general sense a frontier can be fuzzy or diffuse. 　For example, the frontier between the Eastern United States and the Old West in the 1800s was an area where European American settlements gradually thinned out and gave way to Native American settlements or uninhabited land. 　The frontier was not always a single continuous area, as California and various large cities were populated before the land that connected those to the East. 　Frontiers and borders also imply different geopolitical strategies. 　In Ancient Rome, the Roman Republic experienced a period of active expansion and creating new frontiers. 　From the reign of Augustus onward, the Roman borders turned into defensive boundaries that divided the Roman and non-Roman realms. 　In the eleventh-century China, China's Song Dynasty defended its northern border with the nomadic Liao empire by building an extensive manmade forest. 　Later in the early twelfth century, Song Dynasty invaded the Liao and dismantled the northern forest, converting the former defensive border into an expanding frontier. 　In modern history, colonialism and imperialism has applied and produced elaborate use and concepts of a frontier, especially in the settler colonial states of North America, expressed by the "Manifest Destiny" and "Frontier Thesis". 　Mobile frontiers was discussed during the Schengen convention. 　It was used by Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru to describe Mao Zedong's actions of grabbing Indian territory before and during the 1962 War through a creeping process. 　Albert Nevett, in his 1954 book "India Going Red?" wrote that "The Empire of Soviet Communism has 'mobile frontiers'".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collecting>Collecting</a> </h2>
<p>The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining items that are of interest to an individual collector. 　Collections differ in a wide variety of respects, most obviously in the nature and scope of the objects contained, but also in purpose, presentation, and so forth. 　The range of possible subjects for a collection is practically unlimited, and collectors have realised a vast number of these possibilities in practice, although some are much more popular than others. 　In collections of manufactured items, the objects may be antique or simply collectable. 　Antiques are collectable items at least 100 years old, while other collectables are arbitrarily recent. 　The word vintage describes relatively old collectables that are not yet antiques. 　Collecting is a childhood hobby for some people, but for others a lifelong pursuit or something started in adulthood. 　Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. 　Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning how to build a collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. 　The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(meteorology)>Accretion (meteorology)</a> </h2>
<p>Accretion is defined as the gradual collection of something over time. 　In meteorology or atmospheric science it is the process of accumulation of frozen water as precipitation over time as it descends through the atmosphere, in particular when an ice crystal or snowflake hits a supercooled liquid droplet, which then freeze together, increasing the size of the water particle. 　The collection of these particles eventually forms snow or hail in clouds and depending on lower atmosphere temperatures may become rain, sleet, or graupel. 　Accretion is the basis for cloud formation and can also be seen as water accumulates on the particulate matter and form jet contrails. 　This is because water vapor in the air requires condensation nuclei to form large droplets of solid or liquid water.</p>

<p>A logo (abbreviation of logotype; from Ancient Greek λόγος (lógos) 'word, speech', and τύπος (túpos) 'mark, imprint') is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. 　It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a wordmark. 　In the days of hot metal typesetting, a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF Garamond), as opposed to a ligature, which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word. 　By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged typeface or colophon. 　At the level of mass communication and in common usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its trademark or brand.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting>Counting</a> </h2>
<p>Counting is the process of determining the number of elements of a finite set of objects, i.e., determining the size of a set. 　The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. 　The related term enumeration refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element. 　Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, "counting by twos" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or "counting by fives" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...). 　There is archaeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at least 50,000 years. 　Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as the number of group members, prey animals, property, or debts (that is, accountancy). 　Notched bones were also found in the Border Caves in South Africa that may suggest that the concept of counting was known to humans as far back as 44,000 BCE. 　The development of counting led to the development of mathematical notation, numeral systems, and writing.</p>

<p>Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. 　Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions. 　Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks. 　Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. 　Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. 　Archeological evidence of cooking fires from at least 300,000 years ago exists, but some estimate that humans started cooking up to 2 million years ago. 　The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. 　New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling of water, expanded cooking techniques. 　Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.</p>
