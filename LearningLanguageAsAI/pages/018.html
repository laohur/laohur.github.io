<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught>Caught</a> </h2>
<p>Caught is a method of dismissing a batsman in cricket. 　A batsman is out caught if the batsman hits the ball, from a legitimate delivery, with the bat, and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground. 　If the ball hits the stumps after hitting the wicket-keeper, If the wicket-keeper fails to do this, the delivery is a "no ball", and the batsman cannot be stumped (nor run out, unless he attempts to run to the other wicket.) If the catch taken by the wicket-keeper,then informally it is known as caught behind or caught at the wicket. 　A catch by the bowler is known as caught and bowled. 　This has nothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the catcher and bowler are the same player. 　(The scorecard annotation is usually 　c. and 　b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name.　) Caught is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition, accounting for 36,190 Test match dismissals between 1877 and 2012, which is 56.9% of all Test match dismissals in this period. 　South African wicket-keeper Mark Boucher holds the record for the most Test match catches, with 532, while Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most Test match catches by non-wicket-keepers, with 210.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire>Empire</a> </h2>
<p>An empire is a political unit made up of several territories and peoples, "usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries". 　The center of the empire (sometimes referred to as the metropole) exercises political control over the peripheries. 　Within an empire, different populations have different sets of rights and are governed differently. 　Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state whose head of state is an emperor; but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called empires or ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples). 　There have been "ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign" Empires. 　An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire; and those created by sea-power, which include territories that are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as the Carthaginian Empire and British Empire. 　Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organization controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). 　The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. 　Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance>Dance</a> </h2>
<p>Dance is an art form consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected. 　Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. 　An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. 　Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics. 　Dance is not solely restricted to performance, though, as dance is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities. 　Dance itself has also become a sport for some, with dancing competitions found across the world exhibiting various different styles and standards. 　Dance requires an equal amount of cognitive focus as well as physical strength. 　The demanding yet evolving art-form allows individuals to express themselves creatively through movement, while enabling them to adapt movement that possesses a rhythmical pattern and fluid motions that allure to an audience either onstage or on film. 　Dance is considered to be a very aesthetically pleasing art-form.</p>

<p>A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. 　Depending on the type of van, it can be bigger or smaller than a pickup truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car. 　There is some variation in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. 　The smallest vans, microvans, are used for transporting either goods or people in tiny quantities. 　Mini MPVs, compact MPVs, and MPVs are all small vans usually used for transporting people in small quantities. 　Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. 　Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. 　Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. 　Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_(geology)>Pay (geology)</a> </h2>
<p>Pay is an expression used in hydrocarbon mining. 　It denotes a portion of a reservoir that contains economically recoverable hydrocarbons. 　The term derives from the possibility of "paying" an income surpassing the costs. 　Equivalent terms are pay sand or pay zone. 　Overall interval in which pay volumes occur is the gross pay; smaller portions of the reservoir that meet further criteria for pay (such as permeability and hydrocarbon saturation) are net pay. 　Net pay is determined through placing cut offs on properties like permeability, porosity, water saturation or volume of shale. 　Care needs to be taken to cut out the part of the gross rock volume that has the ability to allow fluids to flow and actually stores hydrocarbons. 　In other cases when determining "Net Reservoir" the remaining rock is that rock that can still store flow hydrocarbons but is not necessary containing hydrocarbons. 　When the cut off is based on the ability of the rock to store hydrocarbons this is called "Net Rock".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window>Window</a> </h2>
<p>A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the exchange of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air. 　Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window. 　Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. 　Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts. 　In addition to this, many modern day windows may have a window screen or mesh, often made of aluminum or fibreglass, to keep bugs out when the window is opened. 　Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, hexagonal windows, single-hung, and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding sash windows, casement windows, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt, and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, lancet windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, Rose windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, double/triple-paned windows, and witch windows. 　The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt, in Alexandria c. 　100 AD. 　Presentations of windows can be seen in ancient Egyptian wall art and sculptures from Assyria. 　Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea, and Japan. 　In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century. 　In the 19th century American west, greased paper windows came to be used by itinerant groups. 　Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were fully perfected.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(geology)>Window (geology)</a> </h2>
<p>A tectonic window, or fenster (lit. "window" in German), is a geologic structure formed by erosion or normal faulting on a thrust system. 　In such a system the rock mass (hanging wall block) that has been transported by movement along the thrust is called a nappe. 　When erosion or normal faulting produces a hole in the nappe where the underlying autochthonous (i.e. un-transported) rocks crop out this is called a window. 　Klippen are also a feature near windows. 　The klippe is the remnant portion of a nappe after erosion has removed connecting portions of the nappe. 　This process results in an outlier of exotic, often nearly horizontally translated strata overlying autochthonous strata. 　Windows can be almost any size, from a couple of metres to hundreds of kilometres. 　Well known examples of tectonic windows are Hohe Tauern window in Eastern Alps or Hrzdavá dolina tectonic window in Western Carpathians. 　Look up autochthonous in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple>Temple</a> </h2>
<p>A temple (from the Latin templum) is a building reserved for spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice. 　Religions which erect temples include Christianity (whose temples are typically called churches), Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism (whose temples are called gurudwara), Jainism (whose temples are sometimes called derasar), Islam (whose temples are called mosques), Judaism (whose temples are called synagogues), Zoroastrianism (whose temples are sometimes called Agiary), the Baha'i Faith (which are often simply referred to as Baha'i House of Worship), Taoism (which are sometimes called Daoguan), Shinto (which are sometimes called Jinja), Confucianism (which are sometimes called the Temple of Confucius), and ancient religions such as the Ancient Egyptian religion and the Ancient Greek religion. 　The form and function of temples are thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be, in some sense, the "house" of one or more deities. 　Typically, offerings of some sort are made to the deity, and other rituals are enacted, and a special group of clergy maintain and operate the temple. 　The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts, or even the whole main building. 　can only be accessed by the clergy. 　Temples typically have a main building and a larger precinct, which may contain many other buildings or may be a dome-shaped structure, much like an igloo. 　The word comes from Ancient Rome, where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or augur. 　It has the same root as the word "template," a plan in preparation for the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur.</p>

<p>A medal or medallion is a small portable artistic object, a thin disc, normally of metal, carrying a design, usually on both sides. 　They typically have a commemorative purpose of some kind, and many are presented as awards. 　They may be intended to be worn, suspended from clothing or jewellery in some way, although this has not always been the case. 　They may be struck like a coin by dies or die-cast in a mould. 　A medal may be awarded to a person or organisation as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, cultural, academic, or various other achievements. 　Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. 　Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. 　In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient. 　An artist who creates medals or medallions is called a "medalist". 　Medals have long been popular collectible items, and in numismatics form a class called either exonumia or militaria. 　In the proper use of the term, medallions are larger, starting at perhaps four inches across, and are, as such, usually too large to be worn very comfortably, though in colloquial use, "medallion" is often used to refer to a medal used as the pendant of a necklace (as in the medallion man fashion style of the 1960s and 1970s), or for other types of medals. 　Medallions may also be called "table medals" because they are too large to be worn and can only be displayed on a wall, table top, desk, or cabinet.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle>Castle</a> </h2>
<p>A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. 　Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. 　This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a pleasance which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction. 　Use of the term has varied over time and has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. 　Over the approximately 900 years when genuine castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace. 　European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. 　These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies. 　Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. 　Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source. 　Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. 　Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. 　In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. 　This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire. 　Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle's firepower. 　These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. 　Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. 　Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape. 　Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. 　While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. 　As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. 　From the 18th century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)>Cell (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life forms. 　Every cell consists of a cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, and contains many biomolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as many small molecules of nutrients and metabolites. 　The term comes from the Latin word cellula meaning 'small room'. 　Cells can acquire specified function and carry out various tasks within the cell such as replication, DNA repair, protein synthesis, and motility. 　Cells are capable of specialization and mobility within the cell. 　Most cells are measured in micrometers due to their small size. 　Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres. 　Electron microscopy gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure. 　Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals). 　Most unicellular organisms are classed as microorganisms. 　The number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species; it has been approximated that the human body contains an estimated 37 trillion (3.72×1013) cells. 　The brain accounts for around 80 billion of these cells. 　The study of cells and how they work has led to many other studies in related areas of biology, including: discovery of DNA, cancer systems biology, aging and developmental biology. 　Cell biology is the study of cells, which were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery. 　Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. 　Cells emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus>Genus</a> </h2>
<p>Genus (/ˈdʒiːnəs/ plural genera /ˈdʒɛnərə/) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. 　In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. 　In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. 　E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar) are two species within the genus Panthera. 　Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae. 　The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. 　The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera. 　There are some general practices used, however, including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful: monophyly – all descendants of an ancestral taxon are grouped together (i.e. phylogenetic analysis should clearly demonstrate both monophyly and validity as a separate lineage). 　reasonable compactness – a genus should not be expanded needlessly. 　distinctness – with respect to evolutionarily relevant criteria, i.e. ecology, morphology, or biogeography; DNA sequences are a consequence rather than a condition of diverging evolutionary lineages except in cases where they directly inhibit gene flow (e.g. postzygotic barriers). 　Moreover, genera should be composed of phylogenetic units of the same kind as other (analogous) genera.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempt>Attempt</a> </h2>
<p>An attempt to commit a crime occurs if a criminal has an intent to commit a crime and takes a substantial step toward completing the crime, but for reasons not intended by the criminal, the final resulting crime does not occur. 　Attempt to commit a particular crime is a crime, usually considered to be of the same or lesser gravity as the particular crime attempted.　: 669–671  Attempt is a type of inchoate crime, a crime that is not fully developed. 　The crime of attempt has two elements, intent and some conduct toward completion of the crime. 　One group of theories in criminal law is that attempt to commit an act occurs when a person comes dangerously close to carrying out a criminal act, and intends to commit the act, but does not commit it. 　The person may have carried out all the necessary steps (or thought they had) but still failed, or the attempt may have been abandoned or prevented at a late stage. 　The attempt must have gone beyond mere planning or preparation, and is distinct from other inchoate offenses such as conspiracy to commit a crime or solicitation of a crime. 　There are many specific crimes of attempt, such as attempted murder, which may vary by jurisdiction. 　Punishment is often less severe than would be the case if the attempted crime had been carried out. 　Abandonment of the attempt may constitute a not guilty defence, depending partly on the extent to which the attempt was abandoned freely and voluntarily. 　Early common law did not punish attempts; the law of attempt was not recognised by common law until the case of b. 　Rex v. Scofield in 1784.: 669  The essence of the crime of attempt in legal terms is that the defendant has failed to commit the actus reus (the Latin term for the "guilty act") of the full offense, but has the direct and specific intent to commit that full offense. 　The normal rule for establishing criminal liability is to prove an actus reus accompanied by a mens rea ("guilty mind") at the relevant time (see concurrence and strict liability offenses as the exception to the rule).</p>

<p>Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. 　The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage." 　In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. 　Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. 　Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. 　Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. 　Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries. 　It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning. 　Simple pain medications are useful in 20% to 70% of cases. 　Psychological factors such as social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, excitement, or distraction can affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness. 　In some debates regarding physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, pain has been used as an argument to permit people who are terminally ill to end their lives.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine>Machine</a> </h2>
<p>A machine is a physical system using power to apply forces and control movement to perform an action. 　The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such as those employing engines or motors, but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines. 　Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. 　They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems. 　Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage. 　Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use. 　Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as trains, automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory>Victory</a> </h2>
<p>The term victory (from Latin victoria) originally applied to warfare, and denotes success achieved in personal combat, after military operations in general or, by extension, in any competition. 　Success in a military campaign constitutes a strategic victory, while the success in a military engagement is a tactical victory. 　In terms of human emotion, victory accompanies strong feelings of elation, and in human behaviour often exhibits movements and poses paralleling threat display preceding the combat, which are associated with the excess endorphin built up preceding and during combat. 　Victory dances and victory cries similarly parallel war dances and war cries performed before the outbreak of physical violence.　[citation needed] Examples of victory behaviour reported in Roman antiquity, where the term victoria originated, include: the victory songs of the Batavi mercenaries serving under Gaius Julius Civilis after the victory over Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD (according to Tacitus); and also the "abominable song" to Wodan, sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579.[citation needed] The sacrificial animal was a goat, around whose head the Langobards danced in a circle while singing their victory hymn. 　The Roman Republic and Empire celebrated victories with triumph ceremonies and with monuments such as victory columns (e.g. Trajan's Column) and arches. 　A trophy is a token of victory taken from the defeated party, such as the enemy's weapons (spolia), or body parts (as in the case of head hunters). 　Mythology often deifies victory, as in the cases of the Greek Nike or the Roman Victoria. 　The victorious agent is a hero, often portrayed as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a monster (as Saint George slaying the dragon, Indra slaying Ahi, Thor slaying the Midgard Serpent etc.). 　Sol Invictus ("the Invincible Sun") of Roman mythology became an epithet of Christ in Christianity. 　Paul of Tarsus presents the resurrection of Christ as a victory over Death and Sin (1 Corinthians 15:55). 　The Latinate English-language word victory (from the 14th century) replaced the Old English equivalent term sige (cognate with Gothic sigis, Old High German sigu and Sieg in modern German), a frequent element in Germanic names (as in Sigibert, Sigurd etc.), cognate to Celtic sego and Sanskrit sahas.　[citation needed]</p>
