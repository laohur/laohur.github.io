<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture>Mixture</a> </h2>
<p>In chemistry, a mixture is a material made up of two or more different chemical substances which are not chemically bonded. 　A mixture is the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions and colloids. 　Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances such as elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup. 　Despite the fact that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of the components. 　Some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical (mechanical or thermal) means. 　Azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually poses considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova>Nova</a> </h2>
<p>A nova (plural novae or novas) is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star (hence the name "nova", which is Latin for "new") that slowly fades over weeks or months. 　Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. 　All observed novae involve white dwarfs in close binary systems. 　The main sub-classes of novae are classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and dwarf novae. 　They are all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. 　Classical nova eruptions are the most common type. 　They are likely created in a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and either a main sequence, subgiant, or red giant star. 　When the orbital period falls in the range of several days to one day, the white dwarf is close enough to its companion star to start drawing accreted matter onto the surface of the white dwarf, which creates a dense but shallow atmosphere. 　This atmosphere, mostly consisting of hydrogen, is thermally heated by the hot white dwarf and eventually reaches a critical temperature causing ignition of rapid runaway fusion. 　The sudden increase in energy expels the atmosphere into interstellar space creating the envelope seen as visible light during the nova event. 　Such were taken in past centuries to be a new star. 　A few novae produce short-lived nova remnants, lasting for perhaps several centuries. 　Recurrent nova processes are the same as the classical nova, except that the fusion ignition may be repetitive because the companion star can again feed the dense atmosphere of the white dwarf. 　Novae most often occur in the sky along the path of the Milky Way, especially near the observed Galactic Center in Sagittarius; however, they can appear anywhere in the sky. 　They occur far more frequently than galactic supernovae, averaging about ten per year in the Milky Way. 　Most are found telescopically, perhaps only one every 12–18 months reaching naked-eye visibility. 　Novae reaching first or second magnitude occur only several times per century. 　The last bright nova was V1369 Centauri reaching 3.3 magnitude on 14 December 2013.</p>

<p>Coordinates: 15°N 101°E﻿ / ﻿15°N 101°E﻿ / 15; 101 You may need rendering support to display the Thai text in this article correctly. 　Thailand (/ˈtaɪlænd, -lənd/ TY-land, -⁠lənd), historically known as Siam (/saɪˈæm, ˈsaɪæm/) and officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia, located at the centre of the Indochinese Peninsula, spanning 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million. 　The country is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the extremity of Myanmar. 　Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to the southeast, and Indonesia and India to the southwest. 　Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city. 　Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century. 　Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang, Sukhothai, Lan Na and Ayutthaya, which also rivalled each other. 　European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. 　Ayutthaya reached its peak during the 18th century, until it was destroyed in the Burmese–Siamese War. 　Taksin quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. 　He was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty. 　Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia, Siam remained the only nation in the region to avoid colonization by foreign powers, although it was often forced to make territorial, trade and legal concessions in unequal treaties. 　The Siamese system of government was centralised and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy in the reign of Chulalongkorn. 　In World War I, Siam sided with the Allies, a political decision made in order to amend the unequal treaties. 　Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, becoming an ally of Japan in World War II. 　In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. 　Thailand became a major ally of the United States, and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of the failed SEATO, but from 1975 sought to improve relations with Communist China and Thailand's neighbours. 　Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. 　Since the 2000s the country has been caught in continual bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, which resulted in two coups (in 2006 and 2014), along with the establishment of its current constitution, a nominally democratic government after the 2019 Thai general election, and large pro-democracy protests in 2020–2021 which included unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy. 　Since 2019, it has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy; in practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's hold on power. 　Thailand is a middle power in global affairs and a founding member of ASEAN, and ranks very high in the Human Development Index. 　It has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 22nd-largest in the world by PPP. 　Thailand is classified as a newly industrialised economy, with manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism as leading sectors.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk>Silk</a> </h2>
<p>Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. 　The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. 　The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). 　The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors. 　Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. 　There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level. 　Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives. 　Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, caddisflies, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges. 　Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids, such as spiders.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint>Paint</a> </h2>
<p>Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. 　It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture. 　Paint can be made in many colors—and in many different types. 　Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. 　Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics. 　For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers.　[citation needed] Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint. 　Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.) Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 °C (50 °F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 °C (35 °F).</p>

<p>Islam (/ˈɪslɑːm/; Arabic: ۘالِإسلَام, al-ʾIslām [ɪsˈlaːm] (listen), transl. 　"Submission [to God]") is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion centered around the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad. 　Adherents of Islam, called Muslims, number approximately 1.9 billion globally and are the world's second-largest religious population after Christians. 　Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times through earlier prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, among others; these earlier revelations are attributed to Judaism and Christianity, which are regarded in Islam as spiritual predecessor faiths. 　Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of God and the unaltered, final revelation. 　They also consider Muhammad as the main and final Islamic prophet. 　The teachings and normative example of Muhammad, called the sunnah, documented in accounts called the hadith, provide a constitutional model for Muslims. 　Islam teaches that God is one and incomparable. 　It states that there will be a "Final Judgement" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise (jannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (jahannam). 　The Five Pillars—considered obligatory acts of worship—comprise the Islamic oath and creed (shahada); daily prayers (salah); almsgiving (zakat); fasting (sawm) in the month of Ramadan; and a pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. 　Islamic law, sharia, touches on virtually every aspect of life, from banking and finance and welfare to men's and women's roles and the environment. 　Prominent religious festivals include Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. 　The three holiest sites in Islam in descending order are Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. 　Islam originated in the 7th century in Mecca. 　Muslim rule expanded outside Arabia under the Rashidun Caliphate and the subsequent Umayyad Caliphate ruled from the Iberian Peninsula to the Indus Valley. 　In the Islamic Golden Age, mostly during the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate, much of the Muslim world experienced a scientific, economic and cultural flourishing. 　The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and religious conversion as a result of Islamic missionary activities (dawah), and through conquests. 　There are two major Islamic denominations: Sunni Islam (85–90%) and Shia Islam (10–15%). 　While Sunni–Shia differences initially arose from disagreements over the succession to Muhammad, they grew to cover a broader dimension, both theologically and juridically. 　Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries. 　Approximately 12% of the world's Muslims live in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country; 31% live in South Asia; 20% live in the Middle East–North Africa; and 15% live in sub-Saharan Africa. 　Sizable Muslim communities are also present in the Americas, China, and Europe. 　Due largely to a higher fertility rate, Islam is the world's fastest growing major religious group, and is projected to be the world's largest religion by the end of the 21st century.</p>

<p>Corruption is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organization which is entrusted in a position of authority, in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain. 　Corruption may involve many activities which include bribery, influence peddling and the embezzlement and it may also involve practices which are legal in many countries. 　Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts with an official capacity for personal gain. 　Corruption is most common in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states, and mafia states.　[citation needed] Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degrees and proportions. 　Recent data suggests corruption is on the rise. 　Each individual nation allocates domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and the deterrence of crime. 　Strategies which are undertaken in order to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption. 　Additionally, global initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 also have a targeted goal which is supposed to substantially reduce corruption in all of its forms.</p>

<p>Ash or ashes are the solid remnants of fires. 　Specifically, ash refers to all non-aqueous, non-gaseous residues that remain after something burns. 　In analytical chemistry, to analyse the mineral and metal content of chemical samples, ash is the non-gaseous, non-liquid residue after complete combustion. 　Ashes as the end product of incomplete combustion are mostly mineral, but usually still contain an amount of combustible organic or other oxidizable residues. 　The best-known type of ash is wood ash, as a product of wood combustion in campfires, fireplaces, etc. 　The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining charcoal from incomplete combustion. 　The ashes are of different types. 　Some ashes contain natural compounds that make soil fertile. 　Others have chemical compounds that can be toxic but may break up in soil from chemical changes and microorganism activity. 　Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). 　The World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as alternative when soap is not available.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion>Rebellion</a> </h2>
<p>Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. 　It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established authority.　[citation needed] A rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation.　[citation needed] Rebellion can be individual or collective, peaceful (civil disobedience, civil resistance, and nonviolent resistance) or violent (terrorism, sabotage and guerrilla warfare).　[citation needed] Rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different aims. 　While rebellion generally seeks to evade and/or gain concessions from an oppressive power, a revolt seeks to overthrow and destroy that power, as well as its accompanying laws. 　The goal of rebellion is resistance while a revolt seeks a revolution.　[citation needed] As power shifts relative to the external adversary, or power shifts within a mixed coalition, or positions harden or soften on either side, an insurrection may seesaw between the two forms.　[citation needed]</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion>Diffusion</a> </h2>
<p>Diffusion is the net movement of anything (for example, atoms, ions, molecules, energy) generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. 　Diffusion is driven by a gradient in Gibbs free energy or chemical potential. 　It is possible to diffuse "uphill" from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, like in spinodal decomposition. 　The concept of diffusion is widely used in many fields, including physics (particle diffusion), chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, and finance (diffusion of people, ideas, and price values). 　The central idea of diffusion, however, is common to all of these: a substance or collection undergoing diffusion spreads out from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that substance or collection. 　A gradient is the change in the value of a quantity, for example, concentration, pressure, or temperature with the change in another variable, usually distance. 　A change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient, a change in pressure over a distance is called a pressure gradient, and a change in temperature over a distance is called a temperature gradient. 　The word diffusion derives from the Latin word, diffundere, which means "to spread out." 　A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle random walk, and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk motion. 　Bulk motion, or bulk flow, is the characteristic of advection. 　The term convection is used to describe the combination of both transport phenomena. 　If a diffusion process can be described by Fick's laws, it's called a normal diffusion (or Fickian diffusion); Otherwise, it's called an anomalous diffusion (or non-Fickian diffusion). 　When talking about the extent of diffusion, two length scales are used in two different scenarios: Brownian motion of an impulsive point source (for example, one single spray of perfume)—the square root of the mean squared displacement from this point. 　In Fickian diffusion, this is 2 n D t {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2nDt}}} , where n {\displaystyle n} is the dimension of this Brownian motion; Constant concentration source in one dimension—the diffusion length. 　In Fickian diffusion, this is 2 D t {\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {Dt}}} .</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast>Breast</a> </h2>
<p>The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of a primate's torso. 　Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. 　In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants. 　Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape. 　At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. 　During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. 　Humans are the only animals with permanent breasts. 　At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause permanent breast growth in female humans. 　This happens only to a much lesser extent in other primates—breast development in other primates generally only occurs with pregnancy. 　Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. 　Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. 　They can figure prominently in the perception of a woman's body and sexual attractiveness. 　A number of cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. 　Breasts, especially the nipples, are an erogenous zone.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_(geology)>Horizon (geology)</a> </h2>
<p>In geology, a horizon is either a bedding surface where there is marked change in the lithology within a sequence of sedimentary or volcanic rocks, or a distinctive layer or thin bed with a characteristic lithology or fossil content within a sequence. 　Examples of the former can include things such as volcanic eruptions as well as things such as meteorite impacts and tsunamis. 　Examples of the latter include things such as ice ages and other large climate events, as well as large but temporary geological features and changes such as inland oceans. 　In the interpretation of seismic reflection data, horizons are the reflectors (or seismic events) picked on individual profiles. 　These reflectors represent a change in rock properties across a boundary between two layers of rock, particularly seismic velocity and density. 　It can also represent changes in the density of the material and the composition of it and the pressure under which it was produced. 　Thus, not only do the properties change but so too do the conditions of formation and other differences in the rock. 　The horizons can sometimes be very prominent, such as visible changes in cliff sides, to extremely subtle chemical differences.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon>Horizon</a> </h2>
<p>The horizon is the apparent curve that separates the surface of a celestial body from its sky when viewed from the perspective of an observer on or near the surface of the relevant body. 　This curve divides all viewing directions based on whether it intersects the relevant body's surface or not. 　The true horizon is a theoretical line, which can only be observed to any degree of accuracy when it lies along a relatively smooth surface such as that of Earth's oceans. 　At many locations, this line is obscured by terrain, and on Earth it can also be obscured by life forms such as trees and/or human constructs such as buildings. 　The resulting intersection of such obstructions with the sky is called the visible horizon. 　On Earth, when looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing. 　The true horizon surrounds the observer and it is typically assumed to be a circle, drawn on the surface of a perfectly spherical model of the relevant celestial body, i.e., a small circle of the local osculating sphere. 　With respect to Earth, the center of the true horizon is below the observer and below sea level. 　Its radius or horizontal distance from the observer varies slightly from day to day due to atmospheric refraction, which is greatly affected by weather conditions. 　Also, the higher the observer's eyes are from sea level, the farther away the horizon is from the observer. 　For instance, in standard atmospheric conditions, for an observer with eye level above sea level by 1.70 metres (5 ft 7 in), the horizon is at a distance of about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). 　When observed from very high standpoints, such as a space station, the horizon is much farther away and it encompasses a much larger area of Earth's surface. 　In this case, the horizon would no longer be a perfect circle, not even a plane curve such as an ellipse, especially when the observer is above the equator, as the Earth's surface can be better modeled as an oblate ellipsoid than as a sphere.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwing>Throwing</a> </h2>
<p>Throwing is an action which consists in accelerating a projectile and then releasing it so that it follows a ballistic trajectory, usually with the aim of impacting a remote target. 　This action is best characterized for animals with prehensile limbs: in this case the projectile is grasped, while the limb segments impart a motion of the hand through compounded mechanical advantage. 　For other animals, the definition of throwing is somewhat unclear, as other actions such as spitting or spraying may or may not be included. 　Primates are the most capable throwers in the animal kingdom, and they typically throw feces as a form of agonistic behavior. 　Of all primates, humans are by far the most capable throwers. 　They throw a large variety of projectiles, with a much greater efficacy and accuracy. 　Humans have thrown projectiles for hunting and in warfare – first through rock-throwing, then refined weapon-throwing (e.g. spear), and into modern day with hand grenades and tear gas canisters. 　If humans initially threw objects by hand, they very early designed tools to improve the efficiency of their throwing techniques. 　The sling, the bow and arrow, and various models of catapults are notable examples of throwing mechanisms. 　With the advent of gun powder, research in throwing mechanisms as ranged weapons essentially halted, but throwing either by hand or with mechanical assistance has persisted for recreational purpose or as a form of exercise. 　Throwing is thus still performed in many sports and games, particularly ball games, and in throwing sports the action is the main determiner of the outcome.</p>

<p>Mechanics (from Ancient Greek: μηχανική, mēkhanikḗ, lit. "of machines") is the area of mathematics and physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. 　Forces applied to objects result in displacements, or changes of an object's position relative to its environment. 　Theoretical expositions of this branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece, for instance, in the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). 　During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, Huygens, and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics. 　As a branch of classical physics, mechanics deals with bodies that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 　It can also be defined as the physical science that deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.</p>
