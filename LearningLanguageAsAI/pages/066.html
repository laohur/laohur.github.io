<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology>Biology</a> </h2>
<p>Biology is the scientific study of life. 　It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. 　For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. 　Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. 　Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. 　Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments. 　Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization, from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations. 　Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use. 　Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them. 　Life on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago, is immensely diverse. 　Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. 　These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar>Radar</a> </h2>
<p>Radar is a radiolocation system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), angle (azimuth), and radial velocity of objects relative to the site. 　It is used to detect and track aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, and motor vehicles, and map weather formations, and terrain. 　A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the objects. 　Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the objects and return to the receiver, giving information about the objects' locations and speeds. 　Radar was developed secretly for military use by several countries in the period before and during World War II. 　A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. 　The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for radio detection and ranging. 　The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. 　The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defense systems, anti-missile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anti-collision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, altimetry and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, self-driving cars, and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations. 　Modern high tech radar systems use digital signal processing and machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels. 　Other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. 　One example is lidar, which uses predominantly infrared light from lasers rather than radio waves. 　With the emergence of driver-less vehicles, radar is expected to assist the automated platform to monitor its environment, thus preventing unwanted incidents.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration>Immigration</a> </h2>
<p>Immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle as permanent residents or naturalized citizens. 　Commuters, tourists, and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition of immigration or migration; seasonal labour immigration is sometimes included, however. 　As for economic effects, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. 　Research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. 　Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent for the scenarios in which 37 to 53 percent of the developing countries' workers migrate to the developed countries. 　Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction. 　Positive net immigration can soften the demographic dilemma in the aging global North. 　The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate. 　Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants. 　Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign born and minority populations in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media, and politics in the United States and Europe.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire>Yorkshire</a> </h2>
<p>Yorkshire (/ˈjɔːrkʃər, -ʃɪər/ YORK-shər, -⁠shihər; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county in northern England and the largest by area size in the United Kingdom. 　Because of its large area in comparison with other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. 　Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographic territory and cultural region. 　The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. 　Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are large stretches of countryside, including the Yorkshire Dales, North York Moors and Peak District national parks. 　Yorkshire has been nicknamed "God's Own Country" by its people. 　The emblem of Yorkshire is the White Rose of the English royal House of York, and the most commonly used flag representative of Yorkshire is the white rose on a blue field which, after nearly fifty years of use, was recognised by the Flag Institute on 29 July 2008. 　Yorkshire Day, held annually on 1 August, is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, ranging from its history to its dialect. 　Yorkshire is covered by different Government Office Regions. 　Most of the county falls within Yorkshire and the Humber while the extreme northern part of the county, such as Middlesbrough, Redcar, Holwick and Startforth, falls within North East England. 　Small areas in the west of the county are covered by the North West England region.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir>Choir</a> </h2>
<p>A choir (/ˈkwaɪər/ KWIRE; also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. 　Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. 　Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. 　Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm, hand, and facial gestures. 　The term choir is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the quire), whereas a chorus performs in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is not rigid. 　Choirs may sing without instruments, or accompanied by a piano, pipe organ, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. 　A choir can be a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the "woodwind choir" of an orchestra, or different "choirs" of voices or instruments in a polychoral composition. 　In typical 18th century to 21st century oratorios and masses, 'chorus' or 'choir' implies that there is more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream>Cream</a> </h2>
<p>Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. 　In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. 　In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators". 　In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. 　It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat. 　Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. 　Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and "cheesy". 　In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. 　Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. 　Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; traces of these intensely colored pigments give milk a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. 　Carotenoids are also the origin of butter's yellow color. 　Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail>Retail</a> </h2>
<p>Retail is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is sale to business or institutional customers. 　A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. 　Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers. 　Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. 　Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. 　Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than "rude booths" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era. 　In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. 　Digital technologies are also affecting the way that consumers pay for goods and services. 　Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services. 　Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services, and the store's overall market positioning. 　Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel, and presentation.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey>Honey</a> </h2>
<p>Honey is a sweet and viscous substance made by several bees, the best-known of which are honey bees. 　Honey is made and stored to nourish bee colonies. 　Bees produce honey by gathering and then refining the sugary secretions of plants (primarily floral nectar) or the secretions of other insects, like the honeydew of aphids. 　This refinement takes place both within individual bees, through regurgitation and enzymatic activity, as well as during storage in the hive, through water evaporation that concentrates the honey's sugars until it is thick and viscous. 　Honey bees stockpile honey in the hive. 　Within the hive is a structure made from wax called honeycomb. 　The honeycomb is made up of hundreds or thousands of hexagonal cells, into which the bees regurgitate honey for storage. 　Other honey-producing species of bee store the substance in different structures, such as the pots made of wax and resin used by the stingless bee. 　Honey for human consumption is collected from wild bee colonies, or from the hives of domesticated bees. 　The honey produced by honey bees is the most familiar to humans, thanks to its worldwide commercial production and availability. 　The husbandry of bees is known as beekeeping or apiculture, with the cultivation of stingless bees usually referred to as meliponiculture. 　Honey is sweet because of its high concentrations of the monosaccharides fructose and glucose. 　It has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (table sugar). 　One standard tablespoon (15 mL) of honey provides around 190 kilojoules (46 kilocalories) of food energy. 　It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. 　Most microorganisms cannot grow in honey and sealed honey therefore does not spoil. 　Samples of honey discovered in archaeological contexts have proven edible even after thousands of years. 　Honey use and production has a long and varied history, with its beginnings in prehistoric times. 　Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Araña in Spain depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago. 　While Apis melifera is an Old World insect, large-scale meliponiculture of New World stingless bees has been practiced by Mayans since pre-Columbian times.</p>

<p>In astrology, reception is a condition where one planet is located in a sign where a second planet has astrological dignity--for example, a sign which the second planet rules or in which it is exalted, or where the second planet is the triplicity ruler. 　In such a case, the first planet is said to be "received" by the dignified planet, and this relationship was seen by ancient and medieval astrologers to function in a similar way to that of host and guest. 　The dignified planet is strong, and hence provides support and assistance to the second planet which falls within its purview. 　Consider the Sun in Libra. 　Venus is said to 'receive' the Sun because he is visiting her sign. 　In this capacity Venus is known as the Sun's dispositor. 　— Deborah Houlding, Sometimes this relationship is mutual—that is, each planet is in each other's sign of dignity. 　This condition is called mutual reception or "exchange of signs" and can be very beneficial to both planets.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians>Christians</a> </h2>
<p>Christians (/ˈkrɪstʃən, -tiən/ (listen)) are people who follow or adhere to Christianity, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. 　The words Christ and Christian derive from the Koine Greek title Christós (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach (מָשִׁיחַ) (usually rendered as messiah in English). 　While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict, they are united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance. 　The term Christian used as an adjective is descriptive of anything associated with Christianity or Christian churches, or in a proverbial sense "all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like." 　It does not have a meaning of 'of Christ' or 'related or pertaining to Christ'. 　According to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey, there were 2.2 billion Christians around the world in 2010, up from about 600 million in 1910. 　Today, about 37% of all Christians live in the Americas, about 26% live in Europe, 24% live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 13% live in Asia and the Pacific, and 1% live in the Middle East and North Africa. 　Christians make up the majority of the population in 158 countries and territories. 　280 million Christians live as a minority. 　About half of all Christians worldwide are Catholic, while more than a third are Protestant (37%). 　Orthodox communions comprise 12% of the world's Christians. 　Other Christian groups make up the remainder. 　By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion. 　According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, Christianity will remain the world's largest religion in 2050, if current trends continue. 　In recent history, Christians have experienced persecution of varying severity, especially in the Middle-East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver>Vancouver</a> </h2>
<p>Vancouver (/vænˈkuːvər/ (listen) van-KOO-vər) is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. 　As the most populous city in the province, the 2021 Canadian census recorded 662,248 people in the city, up from 631,486 in 2016. 　The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2.6 million in 2021, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. 　Greater Vancouver, along with the Fraser Valley, comprises the Lower Mainland with a regional population of over 3 million. 　Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada, with over 5,700 people per square kilometre, and fourth highest in North America (after New York City, San Francisco, and Mexico City). 　Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 49.3 percent of its residents are not native English speakers, 47.8 percent are native speakers of neither English nor French, and 54.5 percent of residents belong to visible minority groups. 　It has been consistently ranked one of the most livable cities in Canada and in the world. 　In terms of housing affordability, Vancouver is also one of the most expensive cities in Canada and in the world. 　Vancouver plans to become the greenest city in the world. 　Vancouverism is the city's urban planning design philosophy. 　Indigenous settlement of Vancouver began more than 10,000 years ago, and included the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples. 　The beginnings of the modern city, which was originally named Gastown, grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of Hastings Mill that was built on July 1, 1867, and owned by proprietor Gassy Jack. 　The original site is marked by the Gastown steam clock. 　Gastown then formally registered as a townsite dubbed Granville, Burrard Inlet. 　The city was renamed "Vancouver" in 1886, through a deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway. 　The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. 　The city's large natural seaport on the Pacific Ocean became a vital link in the trade between Asia-Pacific, East Asia, Europe, and Eastern Canada. 　Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events, including the 1954 Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, APEC Canada 1997, the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009; several matches of 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup including the finals at BC Place in Downtown Vancouver, and the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler, a resort community 125 km (78 mi) north of the city. 　In 1969, Greenpeace was founded in Vancouver. 　The city became the permanent home to TED conferences in 2014. 　As of 2016[update], the Port of Vancouver is the fourth-largest port by tonnage in the Americas, the busiest and largest in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America. 　While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest industry. 　Major film production studios in Vancouver and nearby Burnaby have turned Greater Vancouver and nearby areas into one of the largest film production centres in North America, earning it the nickname "Hollywood North".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician>Physician</a> </h2>
<p>A physician (American English), medical practitioner (Commonwealth English), medical doctor, or simply doctor, is a health professional who practices medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. 　Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice. 　Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines, such as anatomy and physiology, underlying diseases and their treatment—the science of medicine—and also a decent competence in its applied practice—the art or craft of medicine. 　Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world. 　Degrees and other qualifications vary widely, but there are some common elements, such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration, compassion, and benevolence for their patients.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear>Gear</a> </h2>
<p>A gear is a rotating circular machine part having cut teeth or, in the case of a cogwheel or gearwheel, inserted teeth (called cogs), which mesh with another (compatible) toothed part to transmit (convert) torque and speed. 　The basic principle behind the operation of gears is analogous to the basic principle of levers. 　A gear may also be known informally as a cog. 　Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source. 　Gears of different sizes produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine. 　The rotational speeds, and the torques, of two meshing gears differ in proportion to their diameters. 　The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape. 　Two or more meshing gears, working in a sequence, are called a gear train or a transmission. 　The gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed, belt pulley system. 　An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage. 　In transmissions with multiple gear ratios—such as bicycles, motorcycles, and cars—the term "gear" (e.g., "first gear") refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear. 　The term describes similar devices, even when the gear ratio is continuous rather than discrete, or when the device does not actually contain gears, as in a continuously variable transmission (CVT). 　Sometimes a CVT is referred to as an "infinitely variable transmission". 　Furthermore, a gear can mesh with a linear toothed part, called a rack, producing movement in a straight line instead of rotation (movement in a circle). 　See Rack and Pinion for an example.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(psychology)>Absorption (psychology)</a> </h2>
<p>Absorption is a disposition or personality trait in which a person becomes absorbed in their mental imagery, particularly fantasy. 　This trait thus correlates highly with a fantasy prone personality. 　The original research on absorption was by American psychologist Auke Tellegen. 　The construct of absorption was developed in order to relate individual differences in hypnotisability to broader aspects of personality. 　Absorption has a variable correlation with hypnotisability (r = 0.13–0.89) perhaps because in addition to broad personality dispositions, situational factors play an important role in performance on tests of hypnotic susceptibility. 　Absorption is one of the traits assessed in the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire.</p>

<p>Absorption is the journey of a drug travelling from the site of administration to the site of action. 　The drug travels by some route of administration (oral, topical-dermal, etc.) in a chosen dosage form (e.g., tablets, capsules, or in solution). 　Absorption by some other routes, such as intravenous therapy, intramuscular injection, enteral nutrition, is even more straightforward and there is less variability in absorption and bioavailability is often near 100%. 　Intravascular administration does not involve absorption, and there is no loss of drug. 　The fastest route of absorption is inhalation. 　Absorption is a primary focus in drug development and medicinal chemistry, since a drug must be absorbed before any medicinal effects can take place. 　Moreover, the drug's pharmacokinetic profile can be easily and significantly changed by adjusting factors that affect absorption.</p>

<p>A première, also spelled premiere, is the debut (first public presentation) of a play, film, dance, or musical composition. 　A work will often have many premières: a world première (the first time it is shown anywhere in the world), its first presentation in each country, and an online première (the first time it is published on the Internet). 　When a work originates in a country that speaks a different language from that in which it is receiving its national or international première, it is possible to have two premières for the same work in the same country—for example, the play The Maids by the French dramatist Jean Genet received its British première (which also happened to be its world première) in 1952, in a production given in the French language. 　Four years later, it was staged again, this time in English, which was its English-language première in Britain.</p>
