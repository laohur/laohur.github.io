<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News>News</a> </h2>
<p>News is information about current events. 　This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events. 　News is sometimes called "hard news" to differentiate it from soft media. 　Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky or unusual events. 　Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. 　Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. 　Throughout history, people have transported new information through oral means. 　Having developed in China over centuries, newspapers became established in Europe during the early modern period. 　In the 20th century, radio and television became an important means of transmitting news. 　Whilst in the 21st, the internet has also begun to play a similar role.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth>Mouth</a> </h2>
<p>In animal anatomy, the mouth, also known as the oral cavity, or in Latin cavum oriscode: lat promoted to code: la , is the opening through which many animals take in food and issue vocal sounds. 　It is also the cavity lying at the upper end of the alimentary canal, bounded on the outside by the lips and inside by the pharynx. 　In tetrapods, it contains the tongue and, except for some like birds, teeth. 　This cavity is also known as the buccal cavity, from the Latin buccacode: lat promoted to code: la ("cheek"). 　Some animal phyla, including arthropods, molluscs and chordates, have a complete digestive system, with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. 　Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify bilaterian animals into protostomes and deuterostomes.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_(archaeology)>Natural (archaeology)</a> </h2>
<p>In archaeology, natural is a term to denote a layer (stratum) in the stratigraphic record where there is no evidence of human impact on the environment. 　While there may be "natural" layers interbedded with archaeologically interesting layers, such as when a site was abandoned for long periods between occupations, the top (or horizon) of the natural layer below which there is no anthropogenic activity on site, and thus where the archaeological record begins, is the point to terminate digging. 　Usually it is the underlying geological makeup of the site that was formed by geologic processes. 　It is the goal of complete excavation to remove the entirety of the archaeological record all the way to the "natural", leaving only the natural deposits of pre-human activity on site. 　If the excavation is related to development, the impact assessment may stipulate excavation will cease at a certain depth, because the nature of the development will not disturb remains below a certain level. 　Such an excavation may not reach a natural or sterile layer.</p>

<p>Coordinates: 60°N 110°W﻿ / ﻿60°N 110°W﻿ / 60; -110 Canada is a country in North America. 　Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering over 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. 　Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest binational land border. 　Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. 　Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. 　Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. 　As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. 　In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. 　This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. 　This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. 　Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. 　The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. 　The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) at the federal level. 　It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability. 　It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. 　Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. 　A highly developed country, Canada has the 24th highest nominal per capita income globally and the fifteenth-highest ranking on the Human Development Index. 　Its advanced economy is the eighth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. 　Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, G7, Group of Ten, G20, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), Commonwealth of Nations, Arctic Council, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and Organization of American States.</p>

<p>Related is an American comedy-drama television series that aired on The WB from October 5, 2005, to March 20, 2006. 　It revolves around the lives of four close-knit sisters of Italian descent, raised in Brooklyn and living in Manhattan. 　The show was created by former Sex and the City writer Liz Tuccillo, and executive produced by Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman. 　Despite heavy promotion, initial ratings did not warrant the show being picked up for a second season when The WB network was folded into The CW.</p>

<p>In hydrology, stage refers to the water level in a river or stream with respect to a chosen reference height. 　Stage is important because direct measurements of river discharge are very difficult while water surface elevation measurements are comparatively easy. 　In order to convert stage into discharge, scientists can use a combination of tracer studies, observations of high water marks, numerical modeling, and/or satellite or aerial photography. 　The relationship between stage and discharge is called a rating curve.</p>

<p>In common usage and in philosophy, ideas are the results of thought. 　Also in philosophy, ideas can also be mental representational images of some object. 　Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. 　The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. 　In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. 　A new or an original idea can often lead to innovation.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum>Quantum</a> </h2>
<p>In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction. 　The fundamental notion that a physical property can be "quantized" is referred to as "the hypothesis of quantization". 　This means that the magnitude of the physical property can take on only discrete values consisting of integer multiples of one quantum. 　For example, a photon is a single quantum of light (or of any other form of electromagnetic radiation). 　Similarly, the energy of an electron bound within an atom is quantized and can exist only in certain discrete values. 　(Atoms and matter in general are stable because electrons can exist only at discrete energy levels within an atom.) 　Quantization is one of the foundations of the much broader physics of quantum mechanics. 　Quantization of energy and its influence on how energy and matter interact (quantum electrodynamics) is part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing nature.</p>

<p>A floor is the bottom surface of a room or vehicle. 　Floors vary from simple dirt in a cave to many layered surfaces made with modern technology. 　Floors may be stone, wood, bamboo, metal or any other material that can support the expected load. 　The levels of a building are often referred to as floors, although a more proper term is storey. 　Floors typically consist of a subfloor for support and a floor covering used to give a good walking surface. 　In modern buildings the subfloor often has electrical wiring, plumbing, and other services built in. 　As floors must meet many needs, some essential to safety, floors are built to strict building codes in some regions.</p>

<p>In metrology (the science of measurement), a standard (or etalon) is an object, system, or experiment that bears a defined relationship to a unit of measurement of a physical quantity. 　Standards are the fundamental reference for a system of weights and measures, against which all other measuring devices are compared. 　Historical standards for length, volume, and mass were defined by many different authorities, which resulted in confusion and inaccuracy of measurements. 　Modern measurements are defined in relationship to internationally standardized reference objects, which are used under carefully controlled laboratory conditions to define the units of length, mass, electrical potential, and other physical quantities.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest>Interest</a> </h2>
<p>In finance and economics, interest is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. 　It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party. 　It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs. 　For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. 　In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower. 　Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. 　(Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.) 　The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage). 　Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. 　Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. 　In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis>Analysis</a> </h2>
<p>Analysis (PL: analyses) is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. 　The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. 　The word comes from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (analysis, "a breaking-up" or "an untying;" from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening"). 　From it also comes the word's plural, analyses. 　As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to Alhazen, René Descartes (Discourse on the Method), and Galileo Galilei. 　It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name). 　The converse of analysis is synthesis: putting the pieces back together again in new or different whole.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running>Running</a> </h2>
<p>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. 　Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). 　This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. 　A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. 　The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting. 　Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy. 　It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals. 　Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. 　Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. 　Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.</p>

<p>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. 　Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. 　The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. 　Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts. 　Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. 　The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. 　This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions. 　The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. 　Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week>Week</a> </h2>
<p>A week is a unit of time equal to seven days. 　It is the standard time period used for short cycles of days in most parts of the world. 　The days are often used to indicate common work days and rest days, as well as days of worship. 　Weeks are often mapped against yearly calendars, but are typically not the basis for them, as weeks are not based on astronomy. 　The modern seven-day week can be traced back to the Babylonians, who used it within their calendar. 　Other ancient cultures had different week lengths, including ten in Egypt and an eight-day week for Etruscans. 　The Etruscan week was adopted by the Ancient Romans, but they later moved to a seven-day week, which had spread across Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean. 　In 321 CE, Emperor Constantine officially decreed a seven-day week in the Roman Empire, including making Sunday a public holiday. 　This later spread across Europe, then the rest of the world. 　In English, the names of the days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 　In many languages, the days of the week are named after gods or planets visible to the eye. 　Such a week may be called a planetary week. 　Certain weeks within a year may be designated for a particular purpose, such as Holy Week in Christianity, Golden Week in China, and National Family Week in Canada. 　More informally, certain groups may advocate awareness weeks, which are designed to draw attention to a certain subject or cause. 　The term "week" may also be used to refer to a sub-section of the week, such as the workweek and weekend. 　Cultures vary in which days of the week are designated the first and the last, though virtually all have Saturday, Sunday or Monday as the first day. 　The Geneva-based ISO standards organization uses Monday as the first day of the week in its ISO week date system through the international ISO 8601 standard. 　Most of Europe and China consider Monday the first day of the week, most of North America and South Asia consider Sunday the first day, while Saturday is judged as the first day of the week in much of the Middle East and North Africa. 　Other regions are mixed, but typically observe either Sunday or Monday as the first day. 　The Jewish week ends with nightfall on Saturday, at the conclusion of the Sabbath, following the Hebrew Bible in which God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. 　Christians set their Sabbath to Sunday, so as not to coincide with Judaism. 　Muslims set their Sabbath to Friday so as not to coincide with either Judaism or Christianity.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold>Gold</a> </h2>
<p>Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. 　This makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. 　It is a bright, slightly orange-yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal in a pure form. 　Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. 　It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. 　Gold often occurs in free elemental (native state), as nuggets or grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial deposits. 　It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium, and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. 　Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). 　Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. 　Gold is insoluble in nitric acid alone, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property long used to refine gold and confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term 'acid test'. 　Gold dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. 　Gold also dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute, this is not a chemical reaction. 　A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history. 　In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy. 　Gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after the Nixon shock measures of 1971. 　In 2020, the world's largest gold producer was China, followed by Russia and Australia. 　A total of around 201,296 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2020[update]. 　This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly 21.7 meters (71 ft). 　The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments and 10% in industry. 　Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion-resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). 　Gold is also used in infrared shielding, production of colored glass, gold leafing, and tooth restoration. 　Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.</p>
