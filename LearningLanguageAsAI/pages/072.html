<p>Coordinates: 4°N 72°W﻿ / ﻿4°N 72°W﻿ / 4; -72 Colombia (/kəˈlʌmbiə/ (listen), /-ˈlɒm-/; Spanish: [koˈlombja] (listen)), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a country in South America with insular regions in North America—near Nicaragua's Caribbean coast—as well as in the Pacific Ocean. 　The Colombian mainland is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north, Venezuela to the east and northeast, Brazil to the southeast, Ecuador and Peru to the south and southwest, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and Panama to the northwest. 　Colombia is divided into 32 departments and the Capital District of Bogotá, the country's largest city. 　It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers (440,831 sq mi), and has a population of 52 million. 　Colombia's cultural heritage—including language, religion, cuisine, and art—reflects its history as a Spanish colony, fusing cultural elements brought by immigration from Europe and the Middle East, with those brought by enslaved Africans, as well as with those of the various Indigenous civilizations that predate colonization. 　Spanish is the official state language, although English and 64 other languages are recognized regional languages. 　Colombia has been home to many indigenous peoples and cultures since at least 12,000 BCE. 　The Spanish first landed in La Guajira in 1499, and by the mid-16th century they had explored and colonized much of present-day Colombia, and established the New Kingdom of Granada, with Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. 　Independence from the Spanish Empire was achieved in 1819, with what is now Colombia emerging as the United Provinces of New Granada. 　The new polity experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858) and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before becoming a republic—the current Republic of Colombia—in 1886. 　With the backing of the United States and France, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, resulting in Colombia's present borders. 　Beginning in the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence, both of which escalated in the 1990s. 　Since 2005, there has been significant improvement in security, stability and rule of law, as well as unprecedented economic growth and development. 　Colombia is one of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries; it has the second-highest level of biodiversity in the world. 　Its territory encompasses Amazon rainforest, highlands, grasslands and deserts. 　It is the only country in South America with coastlines and islands along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 　Colombia is a member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community; it is also a NATO Global Partner. 　Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects. 　However, Colombia remains struggling with ideological divisions, widespread corruption, drug trafficking and other forms of criminal activities.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold>Manifold</a> </h2>
<p>In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. 　More precisely, an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold, or n {\displaystyle n} -manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space. 　One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not lemniscates. 　Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. 　Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane. 　The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. 　Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. 　The concept has applications in computer-graphics given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. CT scans). 　Manifolds can be equipped with additional structure. 　One important class of manifolds are differentiable manifolds; their differentiable structure allows calculus to be done. 　A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. 　Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity. 　The study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and topology.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensation_(psychology)>Compensation (psychology)</a> </h2>
<p>In psychology, compensation is a strategy whereby one covers up, consciously or unconsciously, weaknesses, frustrations, desires, or feelings of inadequacy or incompetence in one life area through the gratification or (drive towards) excellence in another area. 　Compensation can cover up either real or imagined deficiencies and personal or physical inferiority. 　Positive compensations may help one to overcome one's difficulties. 　On the other hand, negative compensations do not, which results in a reinforced feeling of inferiority. 　There are two kinds of negative compensation: Overcompensation, characterized by a superiority goal, leads to striving for power, dominance, self-esteem, and self-devaluation. 　Undercompensation, which includes a demand for help, leads to a lack of courage and a fear for life. 　A well-known example of failing overcompensation is observed in people going through a midlife-crisis. 　Approaching midlife, many people lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses, including their compensatory acts.</p>

<p>Noah (/ˈnoʊ.ə/) is the tenth and last of the pre-Flood patriarchs in the traditions of Abrahamic religions. 　His story appears in the Hebrew Bible (Book of Genesis, chapters 5–9), the Quran and Baha'i writings. 　Noah is referenced in various other books of the Bible, including the New Testament, and in associated deuterocanonical books. 　The Genesis flood narrative is among the best-known stories of the Bible. 　In this account, Noah labored faithfully to build the Ark at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the Flood, which God created after realising that the world was full of sin. 　Afterwards, God made a covenant with Noah and promised never again to destroy all the Earth's creatures with a flood. 　Noah is also portrayed as a "tiller of the soil" and as a drinker of wine. 　After the flood, God commands Noah and his sons to "be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porch>Porch</a> </h2>
<p>A porch (from Old French porche, from Latin porticus "colonnade", from porta "passage") is a room or gallery located in front of an entrance of a building. 　A porch is placed in front of the facade of a building it commands, and forms a low front. 　Alternatively, it may be a vestibule, or a projecting building that houses the entrance door of a building. 　Porches exist in both religious and secular architecture. 　There are various styles of porches, many of which depend on the architectural tradition of its location. 　Porches allow for sufficient space for a person to comfortably pause before entering or after exiting a building, or to relax on. 　Many porches are open on the outward side with balustrade supported by balusters that usually encircles the entire porch except where stairs are found. 　The word "porch" is almost exclusively used for a structure that is outside the main walls of a building or house. 　Porches can exist under the same roof line as the rest of the building, or as towers and turrets that are supported by simple porch posts or ornate colonnades and arches. 　Examples of porches include those found in Queen Anne style architecture, Victorian style houses, Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, or any of the American Colonial style buildings and homes. 　Some porches are small and cover only the entrance area of a building. 　Other porches are larger, sometimes extending beyond an entrance by wrapping around the sides of a building, or even wrapping around completely to surround an entire building. 　A porch can be part of the ground floor or an upper floor, a design used in the Mrs. Lydia Johnson House (built in 1895).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft>Microsoft</a> </h2>
<p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation producing computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. 　Headquartered at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. 　Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. 　Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2019. 　It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta (Facebook). 　Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. 　It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. 　The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. 　Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2  billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011. 　As of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android. 　The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio). 　Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy. 　This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008, entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. 　Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach its highest value since December 1999. 　Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. 　In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively. 　As of 2022[update], Microsoft has the fourth-highest global brand valuation. 　Microsoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini>Mini</a> </h2>
<p>The Mini is a small, two-door, four-seat car, developed as ADO15, and produced by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and its successors, from 1959 through 2000. 　Minus a brief hiatus, original Minis were built for four decades and sold during six, from the last year of the 1950s into the last year of the 20th century, over a single generation, as fastbacks, estates, and convertibles. 　The original Mini is considered an icon of 1960s British popular culture. 　Its space-saving transverse engine and front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80% of the area of the car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation of car makers. 　In 1999, the Mini was voted the second-most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T, and ahead of the Citroën DS and Volkswagen Beetle. 　The front-wheel-drive, transverse-engine layout of the Mini was copied for other "supermini" designs including the Honda N360 (1967), Nissan Cherry (1970), and Fiat 127 (1971). 　The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs. 　This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis. 　It was manufactured at the Longbridge plant in England located next to BMC's headquarters and at the former Morris Motors plant at Cowley near Oxford, in the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor Corporation (Australia) factory in Sydney, Australia, and later also in Spain (Authi), Belgium, Italy (Innocenti) Chile, Malta, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia (IMV). 　The Italian version of the Mini which was sold under the Innocenti marque was produced in Lambrate, a district of Milan. 　The Mini Mark I had three major UK updates: the Mark II, the Clubman, and the Mark III. 　Within these was a series of variations, including an estate car, a pick-up truck, a van, and the Mini Moke, a jeep-like buggy. 　The performance versions, the Mini Cooper and Cooper "S", were successful as both race and rally cars, winning the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965, and 1967. 　In 1966, the first-placed Mini (along with nine other cars) was disqualified after the finish, under a controversial decision that the car's headlights were against the rules. 　On its introduction in August 1959, the Mini was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini-Minor. 　The Austin Seven was renamed Austin Mini in January 1962 and Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969. 　In 1980, it once again became the Austin Mini, and in 1988, just "Mini" (although the "Rover" badge was applied on some models exported to Japan). 　BMW acquired the Rover Group (formerly British Leyland) in 1994, and sold the greater part of it in 2000, but retained the rights to build cars using the Mini name. 　Retrospectively, the car is known as the "Classic Mini" to distinguish it from the modern, BMW influenced MINI family of vehicles produced since 2000.</p>

<p>Shah (/ʃɑː/; Persian: شاه, Šâh [ʃɒːh], lit. 'king') is a royal title that was historically used by the leading figures of Iranian monarchies. 　It was also used by a variety of Persianate societies, such as the Ottoman Empire, the Kazakh Khanate, the Khanate of Bukhara, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, historical Afghan dynasties, and among Gurkhas. 　Rather than regarding himself as simply a king of the concurrent dynasty (i.e. European-style monarchies), each Iranian ruler regarded himself as the Shahanshah (شاهنشاه, Šâhanšâh, lit. 'King of Kings') or Padishah (پادشاه, Pâdešâh, lit. 'Master King') in the sense of a continuation of the original Persian Empire.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology>Theology</a> </h2>
<p>Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine and, more broadly, of religious belief. 　It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries. 　It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. 　Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and, in particular, to reveal themselves to humankind. 　While theology has turned into a secular field[according to whom?], religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship. 　Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument (experiential, philosophical, ethnographic, historical, and others) to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend or promote any myriad of religious topics. 　As in philosophy of ethics and case law, arguments often assume the existence of previously resolved questions, and develop by making analogies from them to draw new inferences in new situations. 　The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. 　Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. 　Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee>Fee</a> </h2>
<p>A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. 　Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. 　Traditionally, professionals in the United Kingdom (and previously the Republic of Ireland) receive a fee in contradistinction to a payment, salary, or wage, and often use guineas rather than pounds as units of account. 　Under the feudal system, a Knight's fee was what was given to a knight for his service, usually the usage of land. 　A contingent fee is an attorney's fee which is reduced or not charged at all if the court case is lost by the attorney. 　A service fee, service charge, or surcharge is a fee added to a customer's bill. 　The purpose of a service charge often depends on the nature of the product and corresponding service provided. 　Examples of why this fee is charged are: travel time expenses, truck rental fees, liability and workers' compensation insurance fees, and planning fees. 　UPS and FedEx have recently begun surcharges for fuel. 　Restaurants and banquet halls charging service charges in lieu of tips must distribute them to their wait staff in some US states (e.g., Massachusetts, New York, Montana), but in the state of Kentucky may keep them. 　A fee may be a flat fee or a variable one, or part of a two-part tariff. 　A membership fee is charged as part of a subscription business model.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis>Dennis</a> </h2>
<p>Dennis or Denis is a first or last name from the Greco-Roman name Dionysius, via one of the Christian saints named Dionysius. 　The name came from Dionysus, the Greek god of ecstatic states, particularly those produced by wine, which is sometimes said to be derived from the Greek Dios (Διός, "of Zeus") and Nysos or Nysa (Νῦσα), where the young god was raised. 　Dionysus (or Dionysos; also known as Bacchus in Roman mythology and associated with the Italic Liber), the Thracian god of wine, represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but also its social and beneficent influences. 　He is viewed as the promoter of civilization, a lawgiver, and lover of peace—as well as the patron deity of both agriculture and the theater. 　Dionysus is a god of mystery religious rites, such as those practiced in honor of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis near Athens. 　In the Thracian mysteries, he wears the "bassaris" or fox-skin, symbolizing new life. 　(See also Maenads.) 　A mediaeval Latinised form of the Anglo-Norman surname Le Denys was Dacus, which correctly meant Dacian, but when the Vikings were about was often used to mean "Danish" or "The Dane". 　The name became modernised as Denys, then later as Dennis. 　Alternative forms and spellings of the name include Denis, Denys, Dennys, Denish, Deon, Deonne, Deonte, and Dion, Dionice. 　Diminutive forms include Den, Dennoh, Deno, Denny, Deny and Deen. 　The name Sydenie (alternate spellings: Sydney or Sidney) may derive from a village in Normandy called Saint-Denis.　[citation needed] A medieval diminutive was Dye, from which the names Dyson and Tyson are derived.　[citation needed] Dennis is a very popular English, Irish and Danish name, common throughout the English-speaking world, and a very popular French name, common throughout the Francophone world. 　It is also common as a German, Italian, Dutch, Croatian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Brazilian, Bosnian, and Albanian name. 　Dionizy is the Polish version of the name, while Dionigi and Dionisio are the Italian versions of the name. 　The Irish name Donnchadh may be anglicised as Denis, but has a different origin and is in fact related to the name Duncan. 　Feminine versions of the name include: Denise, Denisa, Deni, Denice, Deniece, Dione, and Dionne.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyja>Freyja</a> </h2>
<p>In Norse paganism, Freyja (Old Norse "(the) Lady") is a goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold, and seiðr (magic for seeing and influencing the future). 　Freyja is the owner of the necklace Brísingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar Hildisvíni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. 　By her husband Óðr, she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. 　Along with her twin brother Freyr, her father Njörðr, and her mother (Njörðr's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. 　Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja. 　Freyja rules over her heavenly field, Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. 　The other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. 　Within Fólkvangr lies her hall, Sessrúmnir. 　Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful jötnar who wish to make her their wife. 　Freyja's husband, the god Óðr, is frequently absent. 　She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. 　Freyja has numerous names, including Gefn, Hörn, Mardöll, Sýr, Vanadís, and Valfreyja. 　Freyja is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, composed by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century; in several Sagas of Icelanders; in the short story "Sörla þáttr"; in the poetry of skalds; and into the modern age in Scandinavian folklore. 　Scholars have debated whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples. 　They have connected her to the valkyries, female battlefield choosers of the slain, and analyzed her relation to other goddesses and figures in Germanic mythology, including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn Gullveig/Heiðr, the goddesses Gefjon, Skaði, Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa, Menglöð, and the 1st century CE "Isis" of the Suebi. 　In Scandinavia, Freyja's name frequently appears in the names of plants, especially in southern Sweden. 　Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the Virgin Mary during the process of Christianization. 　Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.</p>

<p>Adelaide (/ˈædɪleɪd/ (listen) AD-il-ayd; Kaurna: Tarntanya), is the capital city of South Australia, the state's largest city and the fifth-most populous city in Australia. 　"Adelaide" may refer to either Greater Adelaide (including the Adelaide Hills) or the Adelaide city centre. 　The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide. 　The Traditional Owners of the Adelaide region are the Kaurna people. 　The area of the city centre and surrounding parklands is called Tarndanya in the Kaurna language. 　Adelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. 　Its metropolitan area extends 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches 96 km (60 mi) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south. 　Named in honour of Queen Adelaide, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia. 　Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens. 　Light's design, now listed as national heritage, set out the city centre in a grid layout known as "Light's Vision", interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands. 　Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. 　Until the post-war era, it was Australia's third most populated city. 　It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the "City of Churches" due to its diversity of faiths. 　Today, Adelaide is known by its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. 　Adelaide's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century, at one stage being named Australia's most liveable city. 　As South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. 　Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevards of North Terrace and King William Street.</p>
