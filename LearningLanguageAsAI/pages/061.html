<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat>Fat</a> </h2>
<p>In nutrition, biology, and chemistry, fat usually means any ester of fatty acids, or a mixture of such compounds, most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food. 　The term often refers specifically to triglycerides (triple esters of glycerol), that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty tissue in animals; or, even more narrowly, to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature, thus excluding oils. 　The term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipid—any substance of biological relevance, composed of carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, that is insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents. 　In this sense, besides the triglycerides, the term would include several other types of compounds like mono- and diglycerides, phospholipids (such as lecithin), sterols (such as cholesterol), waxes (such as beeswax), and free fatty acids, which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts. 　Fats are one of the three main macronutrient groups in human diet, along with carbohydrates and proteins, and the main components of common food products like milk, butter, tallow, lard, salt pork, and cooking oils. 　They are a major and dense source of food energy for many animals and play important structural and metabolic functions, in most living beings, including energy storage, waterproofing, and thermal insulation. 　The human body can produce the fat it requires from other food ingredients, except for a few essential fatty acids that must be included in the diet. 　Dietary fats are also the carriers of some flavor and aroma ingredients and vitamins that are not water-soluble.</p>

<p>In Christian denominations, an archbishop is a bishop of higher rank or office. 　In most cases, such as the Catholic Church, there are many archbishops who either have jurisdiction over an ecclesiastical province in addition to their own archdiocese (with some exceptions), or are otherwise granted a titular archbishopric. 　In others, such as the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the title is only borne by the leader of the denomination.</p>

<p>A phenomenon (PL: phenomena) is an observable event. 　The term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who contrasted it with the noumenon, which cannot be directly observed. 　Kant was heavily influenced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. 　Far predating this, the ancient Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus also used phenomenon and noumenon as interrelated technical terms.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franc>Franc</a> </h2>
<p>Franc The franc is any of various units of currency. 　One franc is typically divided into 100 centimes. 　The name is said to derive from the Latin inscription francorum rex (King of the Franks) used on early French coins and until the 18th century, or from the French franc, meaning "frank" (and "free" in certain contexts, such as coup franc, "free kick"). 　The countries that use francs today include Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and most of Francophone Africa. 　The Swiss franc is a major world currency today due to the prominence of Swiss financial institutions. 　Before the introduction of the euro in 1999, francs were also used in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, while Andorra and Monaco accepted the French franc as legal tender (Monégasque franc). 　The franc was also used within the French Empire's colonies, including Algeria and Cambodia. 　The franc is sometimes Italianised or Hispanicised as the franco, for instance in Luccan franco.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans>Germans</a> </h2>
<p>Germans (German: Deutsche, pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃə] (listen)) are the natives or inhabitants of Germany, and sometimes more broadly any people who are of German descent or native speakers of the German language. 　The constitution of Germany defines a German as a German citizen. 　During the 19th and much of the 20th century, discussions on German identity were dominated by concepts of a common language, culture, descent, and history. 　Today, the German language is widely seen as the primary, though not exclusive, criterion of German identity. 　Estimates on the total number of Germans in the world range from 100 to 150 million, and most of them live in Germany. 　The history of Germans as an ethnic group began with the separation of a distinct Kingdom of Germany from the eastern part of the Frankish Empire under the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th century, forming the core of the Holy Roman Empire. 　In subsequent centuries the political power and population of this empire grew considerably. 　It expanded eastwards, and eventually a substantial number of Germans migrated further eastwards into Eastern Europe. 　The empire itself was politically divided between many small princedoms, cities and bishoprics. 　Following the Reformation in the 16th century, many of these states found themselves in bitter conflict concerning the rise of Protestantism. 　The 19th century saw the dismemberment of the Holy Roman Empire and the growth of German nationalism. 　The kingdom of Prussia incorporated most of the Germans into its German Empire in 1871, while a substantial number of Germans also inhabited the multiethnic kingdom of Austria-Hungary. 　During this time a large number of Germans emigrated to the New World, particularly to the United States, Canada and Brazil, as well as establishing prominent communities in New Zealand and Australia. 　The Russian Empire also contained a substantial German population. 　In the aftermath of World War I, Austria-Hungary and the German Empire were partitioned, resulting in many Germans becoming ethnic minorities in newly established countries. 　In the chaotic years that followed, Adolf Hitler became the dictator of Nazi Germany and embarked on a genocidal campaign to unify all Germans under his leadership. 　This endeavour resulted in World War II and the Holocaust. 　In the aftermath of Germany's defeat in the war, the country was occupied and partitioned. 　Millions of Germans were expelled from Eastern Europe. 　In 1990, the states of West and East Germany were reunified. 　In modern times, remembrance of the Holocaust has become an integral part of German identity (Erinnerungskulturcode: deu promoted to code: de ). 　Owing to their long history of political fragmentation, the Germans are culturally diverse and often have strong regional identities. 　The arts and sciences are an integral part of German culture, and the Germans have produced a large number of prominent personalities in a number of disciplines.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology>Psychology</a> </h2>
<p>Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. 　Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. 　It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. 　Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. 　As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups. 　Ψ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived (see below), is commonly associated with the science. 　A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. 　Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists. 　Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior. 　Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. 　Psychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. 　Psychologists' interests extend to interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. 　They also consider the unconscious mind. 　Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. 　Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation. 　While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. 　By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. 　Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing psychotherapy in clinical, counseling, or school settings. 　Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior. 　Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, or hospitals). 　Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings. 　Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensic science, education, and the media.</p>

<p>Eve (/ˈiːv/; Hebrew: חַוָּה‎‎, Modern: Ḥava, Tiberian: Ḥawwā; Arabic: حَوَّاء, romanized: Ḥawwāʾ; Greek: Εὕα, romanized: Heúa; Latin: Eva, Heva; Syriac: ܚܰܘܳܐ romanized: ḥawâ) is a figure in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. 　According to the origin story of the Abrahamic religions, she was the first woman, yet some debate within Judaism has also given that position to Lilith. 　Eve is known also as Adam's wife. 　According to the second chapter of Genesis, Eve was created by God (Yahweh) by taking her from the rib of Adam, to be Adam's companion. 　Adam is charged with guarding and keeping the garden before her creation; she is not present when God commands Adam not to eat the forbidden fruit – although it is clear that she was aware of the command. 　She decides to eat the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil after she hears the serpent's argument that it would not kill her but bring her benefits. 　She shares the fruit with Adam, and before they could eat of the tree of life, they are expelled from the Garden of Eden. 　Christian churches differ on how they view both Adam and Eve's disobedience to God (often called the fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. 　Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam (the first man) and Eve to a different level of responsibility for the "fall." 　The Catholic Church by ancient tradition recognizes Eve as a saint, alongside Adam, and the traditional liturgical feast of Saints Adam and Eve has been celebrated on 24 December since the Middle Ages in many European nations, including Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, and the Scandinavian nations.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort>Resort</a> </h2>
<p>A resort (North American English) is a self-contained commercial establishment that tries to provide most of a vacationer's wants, such as food, drink, swimming, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping, on the premises. 　The term resort may be used for a hotel property that provides an array of amenities, typically including entertainment and recreational activities. 　A hotel is frequently a central feature of a resort, such as the Grand Hotel at Mackinac Island, Michigan. 　Some resorts are also condominium complexes that are timeshares or owned fractionally or wholly owned condominium. 　A resort is not always a commercial establishment operated by a single company, but in the late 20th century, that sort of facility became more common. 　In British English, "resort" means a town which people visit for holidays and days out which usually contains hotels at which such holidaymakers stay. 　Examples would include Blackpool and Brighton.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent>Patent</a> </h2>
<p>A patent is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for publishing an enabling disclosure of the invention. 　In most countries, patent rights fall under private law and the patent holder must sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce their rights. 　In some industries patents are an essential form of competitive advantage; in others they are irrelevant.　: 17  The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. 　Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims that define the scope of protection that is being sought. 　A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. 　Under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. 　Nevertheless, there are variations on what is patentable subject matter from country to country, also among WTO member states. 　TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature>Signature</a> </h2>
<p>A signature (/ˈsɪɡnətʃər/; from Latin: signare, "to sign") is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name, nickname, or even a simple "X" or other mark that a person writes on documents as a proof of identity and intent. 　The writer of a signature is a signatory or signer. 　Similar to a handwritten signature, a signature work describes the work as readily identifying its creator. 　A signature may be confused with an autograph, which is chiefly an artistic signature. 　This can lead to confusion when people have both an autograph and signature and as such some people in the public eye keep their signatures private whilst fully publishing their autograph.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony>Symphony</a> </h2>
<p>A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often for orchestra. 　Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. 　Symphonies are almost always scored for an orchestra consisting of a string section (violin, viola, cello, and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30 to 100 musicians. 　Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. 　Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their own instrument. 　Some symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn>Brooklyn</a> </h2>
<p>Brooklyn (/ˈbrʊklɪn/) is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Kings County, in the U.S. state of New York. 　Kings County is the most populous county in the State of New York, and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, behind New York County (Manhattan). 　Brooklyn is also New York City's most populous borough, with 2,736,074 residents in 2020. 　Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen, Brooklyn is located on the westernmost edge of Long Island and shares a border with the borough of Queens. 　It has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan, across the East River, and is connected to Staten Island by way of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. 　With a land area of 70.82 square miles (183.4 km2) and a water area of 26 square miles (67 km2), Kings County is the state of New York's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area. 　Brooklyn was founded by the Dutch in the 17th century and grew into a busy port city by the 19th century. 　On January 1, 1898, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, in accordance to the new Municipal Charter of "Greater New York", Brooklyn was consolidated in and annexed (along with other areas) to form the current five borough structure of New York City. 　The borough continues to maintain some distinct culture. 　Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves. 　Brooklyn's official motto, displayed on the Borough seal and flag, is Eendraght Maeckt Maght, which translates from early modern Dutch as "Unity makes strength." 　In the first decades of the 21st century, Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as a destination for hipsters, with concomitant gentrification, dramatic house price increases, and a decrease in housing affordability. 　Some new developments are required to include affordable housing units. 　Since the 2010s, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship, high technology start-up firms, postmodern art and design.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans>Jeans</a> </h2>
<p>Jeans are a type of pants or trousers made from denim or dungaree cloth. 　Often the term "jeans" refers to a particular style of trousers, called "blue jeans", with copper-riveted pockets which were invented by Jacob W. Davis in 1871 and patented by Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. 　Prior to the patent, the term "blue jeans" had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue-colored denim. 　"Jean" also references a (historic) type of sturdy cloth commonly made with a cotton warp and wool weft (also known as "Virginia cloth"). 　Jean cloth can be entirely cotton as well, similar to denim. 　Originally designed for miners, modern jeans were popularized as casual wear by Marlon Brando and James Dean in their 1950s films, particularly The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause, leading to the fabric becoming a symbol of rebellion among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. 　From the 1960s onwards, jeans became common among various youth subcultures and subsequently young members of the general population. 　Nowadays, they are one of the most popular types of specialty trousers in Western culture. 　Historic brands include Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort>Comfort</a> </h2>
<p>Comfort (or being comfortable) is a sense of physical or psychological ease, often characterized as a lack of hardship. 　Persons who are lacking in comfort are uncomfortable, or experiencing discomfort. 　A degree of psychological comfort can be achieved by recreating experiences that are associated with pleasant memories, such as engaging in familiar activities, maintaining the presence of familiar objects, and consumption of comfort foods. 　Comfort is a particular concern in health care, as providing comfort to the sick and injured is one goal of healthcare, and can facilitate recovery. 　Persons who are surrounded with things that provide psychological comfort may be described as being "in their comfort zone". 　Because of the personal nature of positive associations, psychological comfort is highly subjective. 　The use of "comfort" as a verb generally implies that the subject is in a state of pain, suffering or affliction, and requires alleviation from that state. 　Where the term is used to describe the support given to someone who has experienced a tragedy, the word is synonymous with consolation or solace. 　However, comfort is used much more broadly, as one can provide physical comfort to someone who is not in a position to be uncomfortable. 　For example, a person might sit in a chair without discomfort, but still find the addition of a pillow to the chair to increase their feeling of comfort. 　Something that provides this type of comfort, which does not seek to relieve hardship, can also be referred to as being "comfy".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky>Rocky</a> </h2>
<p>Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. 　It also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. 　In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), an uneducated, small-time club fighter and debt collector gets an unlikely shot at the world heavyweight championship held by Apollo Creed (Weathers). 　Rocky entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days. 　It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United Artists eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six figure deal for the film rights. 　Principal photography began in January 1976, with filming primarily held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such as the Rocky Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks. 　With an estimated production budget of under $1 million, Rocky popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports dramas which preceded the film. 　Rocky had its premiere in New York City on November 21, 1976, and was released in the United States on December 3. 　Rocky became the highest-grossing film of 1976, earning approximately $225 million worldwide. 　The film received critical acclaim toward Stallone's writing, performance, the story, as well as the film's direction, score, cinematography and editing; among other accolades, it received ten Academy Award nominations and won three, including Best Picture. 　It has been ranked by numerous publications as one of the greatest films of all time, as well as one of the most iconic sports film ever made. 　Rocky and its theme song have become a pop-cultural phenomenon and an important part of 1970s American popular culture spawning a franchise. 　In 2006, the Library of Congress selected Rocky for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</p>
