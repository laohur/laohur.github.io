<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home>Home</a> </h2>
<p>A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans, and sometimes various companion animals. 　It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it. 　Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing. 　Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space. 　The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet. 　The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines – topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics. 　The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.　[citation needed] The concept and experience encompasses the likes of exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness and homelessness.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)>Order (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>Order (Latin: ordo) is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. 　It is classified between family and class. 　In biological classification, the order is a taxonomic rank used in the classification of organisms and recognized by the nomenclature codes. 　An immediately higher rank, superorder, is sometimes added directly above order, with suborder directly beneath order. 　An order can also be defined as a group of related families. 　What does and does not belong to each order is determined by a taxonomist, as is whether a particular order should be recognized at all. 　Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists each taking a different position. 　There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing or recognizing an order. 　Some taxa are accepted almost universally, while others are recognized only rarely. 　The name of an order is usually written with a capital letter. 　For some groups of organisms, their orders may follow consistent naming schemes. 　Orders of plants, fungi, and algae use the suffix -ales (e.g. Dictyotales). 　Orders of birds and fishes use the Latin suffix -(i)formes meaning 'having the form of' (e.g. Passeriformes), but orders of mammals and invertebrates are not so consistent (e.g. Artiodactyla, Actiniaria, Primates).</p>

<p>A last is a mechanical form shaped like a human foot. 　It is used by shoemakers and cordwainers in the manufacture and repair of shoes. 　Lasts typically come in pairs and have been made from various materials, including hardwoods, cast iron, and high-density plastics. 　The term is derived from the Proto-Germanic *laistaz ("track, trace, footprint"); cognates include Swedish läst, Danish læste, German Leisten.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music>Music</a> </h2>
<p>Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. 　Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal. 　While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions. 　The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. 　Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice. 　In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. 　For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and using characteristic motifs. 　In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and responding, while sharing a changing set of notes. 　In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. 　Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated electronically from many performances. 　Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. 　Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones. 　Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. 　The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. 　Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.</p>

<p>In psychology, a set is a group of expectations that shape experience by making people especially sensitive to specific kinds of information. 　A perceptual set, also called perceptual expectancy, is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. 　Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses. 　They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food. 　A mental set is a framework for thinking about a problem. 　It can be shaped by habit or by desire. 　Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game>Game</a> </h2>
<p>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool. 　Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). 　Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. 　They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. 　The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. 　On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. 　Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. 　A toy and a game are not the same. 　Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules. 　Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction[disambiguation needed]. 　Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. 　Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role. 　Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures. 　The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, Side (Ancient Greek: Σίδη 'pomegranate) or Sida was the name of the following figures: Sida, eponym of the city of Sidon in Phoenicia. 　She was the wife of Belus, king of Egypt and mother of Aegyptus and Danaus. 　Otherwise, the wife of Belus was called Achiroe, daughter of the river-god Nilus. 　Side, one of the Danaïdes, condemned to Tartarus for murdering her husband. 　From her, a town in Laconia was believed to derived its name from. 　Side, the first wife of Orion and mother of his daughters Metioche and Menippe. 　She was cast by Hera into Hades because she rivaled the goddess in beauty. 　Modern scholars interpret the supposed marriage of Orion to Side ('pomegranate') as a mythical expression for the ripening of the fruit in the season when the constellation Orion is visible in the night sky. 　Side, a mortal woman who was chased down by her father Ictinus, intending to rape her. 　Side killed herself on her mother's grave, and the gods turned her blood into a pomegranate tree. 　Her father was changed into a kite bird that never rested on pomegranate trees.</p>

<p>In public relations and communication science, publics are groups of individual people, and the public (a.k.a. the general public) is the totality of such groupings. 　This is a different concept to the sociological concept of the Öffentlichkeit or public sphere. 　The concept of a public has also been defined in political science, psychology, marketing, and advertising. 　In public relations and communication science, it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field. 　Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards, and suffered more recent years from being blurred, as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience, market segment, community, constituency, and stakeholder.</p>

<p>A came is a divider bar used between small pieces of glass to make a larger glazing panel. 　There are two kinds of came: the H-shaped sections that hold two pieces together and the U-shaped sections that are used for the borders. 　Cames are mostly made of lead, zinc, copper, brass or brass-capped lead. 　Of the metal strips, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. 　The harder metals are used to work with slightly curved lines and pieces that require greater structural support. 　They can also be used as border came, once again for stability and support.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County>County</a> </h2>
<p>A county is a geographic region of a country used for administrative or other purposes in certain modern nations. 　The term is derived from the Old French comté denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. 　Literal equivalents in other languages, derived from the equivalent of "count", are now seldom used officially, including comté, contea, contado, comtat, condado, Grafschaft, graafschap, and zhupa in Slavic languages; terms equivalent to commune/community are now often instead used. 　When the Normans conquered England, they brought the term with them. 　The Saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of England, calling them shires; many county names derive from the name of the county town (county seat) with the word shire added on: for example, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. 　The Anglo-Saxon terms earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental terms "count" and "county" under the conquering Normans, and over time the two blended and became equivalent. 　Further, the later-imported term became a synonym for the native Old English word sċīr ([ʃiːr]) or, in Modern English, shire – an equivalent administrative division of the kingdom. 　The term "county" evolved, consequently, to designate a level of local administration that was immediately beneath a national government, within a unitary (non-federal) system of government. 　County later also became used differently in some federal systems of government, for a local administrative division subordinate to a primary subnational entity, such as a Province (e.g. Canada) or a level 3 territorial unit (NUTS 3). 　In the United States and Canada, founded 600 years later on the British traditions, counties are usually an administrative division set by convenient geographical demarcations, which in governance have certain officeholders (for example sheriffs and their departments) as a part of the state and provincial mechanisms, including geographically common court systems. 　A county may be further subdivided into districts, hundreds, townships or other administrative jurisdictions within the county. 　A county usually, but not always, contains cities, towns, townships, villages, or other municipal corporations, which in most cases are somewhat subordinate or dependent upon county governments. 　Depending on the nation, municipality, and local geography, municipalities may or may not be subject to direct or indirect county control — the functions of both levels are often consolidated into a city government when the area is densely populated. 　Outside English-speaking countries, an equivalent of the term county is often used to describe subnational jurisdictions that are structurally equivalent to counties in the relationship they have with their national government; but which may not be administratively equivalent to counties in predominantly English-speaking countries.</p>

<p>A model is an informative representation of an object, person or system. 　The term originally denoted the plans of a building in late 16th-century English, and derived via French and Italian ultimately from Latin modulus, a measure. 　Models can be divided into physical models (e.g. a model plane) and abstract models (e.g. mathematical expressions describing behavioural patterns). 　Abstract or conceptual models are central to philosophy of science, as almost every scientific theory effectively embeds some kind of model of the physical or human sphere. 　In commerce, "model" can refer to a specific design of a product as displayed in a catalogue or show room (e.g. Ford Model T), and by extension to the sold product itself. 　Types of models include:</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Want>Want</a> </h2>
<p>The idea of want can be examined from many perspectives. 　In secular societies want might be considered similar to the emotion desire, which can be studied scientifically through the disciplines of psychology or sociology. 　Want might also be examined in economics as a necessary ingredient in sustaining and perpetuating capitalist societies that are organised around principles like consumerism. 　Alternatively want can be studied in a non-secular, spiritual, moralistic or religious way, particularly by Buddhism but also Christianity, Islam and Judaism. 　In economics, a want is something that is desired. 　It is said that every person has unlimited wants, but limited resources (economics is based on the assumption that only limited resources are available to us). 　Thus, people cannot have everything they want and must look for the most affordable alternatives. 　Wants are often distinguished from needs. 　A need is something that is necessary for survival (such as food and shelter), whereas a want is simply something that a person would like to have. 　Some economists have rejected this distinction and maintain that all of these are simply wants, with varying levels of importance. 　By this viewpoint, wants and needs can be understood as examples of the overall concept of demand. 　Examples of wants that people would like to have is financial monitoring, saving time, higher paying job, more comfort, healthier diet, physical fitness, spirituality, friendship, companionship and safety.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought>Thought</a> </h2>
<p>In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. 　Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. 　But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. 　These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. 　But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes. 　In a slightly different sense, the term thought refers not to the mental processes themselves but to mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes. 　Various theories of thinking have been proposed, some of which aim to capture the characteristic features of thought. 　Platonists hold that thinking consists in discerning and inspecting Platonic forms and their interrelations. 　It involves the ability to discriminate between the pure Platonic forms themselves and the mere imitations found in the sensory world. 　According to Aristotelianism, to think about something is to instantiate in one's mind the universal essence of the object of thought. 　These universals are abstracted from sense experience and are not understood as existing in a changeless intelligible world, in contrast to Platonism. 　Conceptualism is closely related to Aristotelianism: it identifies thinking with mentally evoking concepts instead of instantiating essences. 　Inner speech theories claim that thinking is a form of inner speech in which words are silently expressed in the thinker's mind. 　According to some accounts, this happens in a regular language, like English or French. 　The language of thought hypothesis, on the other hand, holds that this happens in the medium of a unique mental language called Mentalese. 　Central to this idea is that linguistic representational systems are built up from atomic and compound representations and that this structure is also found in thought. 　Associationists understand thinking as the succession of ideas or images. 　They are particularly interested in the laws of association that govern how the train of thought unfolds. 　Behaviorists, by contrast, identify thinking with behavioral dispositions to engage in public intelligent behavior as a reaction to particular external stimuli. 　Computationalism is the most recent of these theories. 　It sees thinking in analogy to how computers work in terms of the storage, transmission, and processing of information. 　Various types of thinking are discussed in the academic literature. 　A judgment is a mental operation in which a proposition is evoked and then either affirmed or denied. 　Reasoning, on the other hand, is the process of drawing conclusions from premises or evidence. 　Both judging and reasoning depend on the possession of the relevant concepts, which are acquired in the process of concept formation. 　In the case of problem solving, thinking aims at reaching a predefined goal by overcoming certain obstacles. 　Deliberation is an important form of practical thought that consists in formulating possible courses of action and assessing the reasons for and against them. 　This may lead to a decision by choosing the most favorable option. 　Both episodic memory and imagination present objects and situations internally, in an attempt to accurately reproduce what was previously experienced or as a free rearrangement, respectively. 　Unconscious thought is thought that happens without being directly experienced. 　It is sometimes posited to explain how difficult problems are solved in cases where no conscious thought was employed. 　Thought is discussed in various academic disciplines. 　Phenomenology is interested in the experience of thinking. 　An important question in this field concerns the experiential character of thinking and to what extent this character can be explained in terms of sensory experience. 　Metaphysics is, among other things, interested in the relation between mind and matter. 　This concerns the question of how thinking can fit into the material world as described by the natural sciences. 　Cognitive psychology aims to understand thought as a form of information processing. 　Developmental psychology, on the other hand, investigates the development of thought from birth to maturity and asks which factors this development depends on. 　Psychoanalysis emphasizes the role of the unconscious in mental life. 　Other fields concerned with thought include linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, biology, and sociology. 　Various concepts and theories are closely related to the topic of thought. 　The term "law of thought" refers to three fundamental laws of logic: the law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle, and the principle of identity. 　Counterfactual thinking involves mental representations of non-actual situations and events in which the thinker tries to assess what would be the case if things had been different. 　Thought experiments often employ counterfactual thinking in order to illustrate theories or to test their plausibility. 　Critical thinking is a form of thinking that is reasonable, reflective, and focused on determining what to believe or how to act. 　Positive thinking involves focusing one's attention on the positive aspects of one's situation and is intimately related to optimism.</p>

<p>A father is the male parent of a child. 　Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations. 　A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. 　A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. 　An adoptive father is a man who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption. 　A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. 　A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child. 　The adjective "paternal" refers to a father and comparatively to "maternal" for a mother. 　The verb "to father" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun "fathering". 　Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male). 　Related terms of endearment are dad (dada, daddy), baba, papa, pappa, papasita, (pa, pap) and pop. 　A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album>Album</a> </h2>
<p>An album is a collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium such as digital distribution. 　Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at 33+1⁄3 rpm. 　The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the album era. 　Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. 　The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the cassette tape during the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s, sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s. 　Most albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. 　The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. 　This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or "mixed" together. 　Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed "live", even when done in a studio. 　Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some "live rooms", have reverberation, which creates a "live" sound. 　Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. 　With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track. 　Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. 　Historically, the term "album" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. 　In musical usage, the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. 　Later, collections of related 78 rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). 　When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an "album"; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law>Law</a> </h2>
<p>Law is a set of rules that are created and are enforceable by social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior, with its precise definition a matter of longstanding debate. 　It has been variously described as a science and as the art of justice. 　State-enforced laws can be made by a group legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or established by judges through precedent, usually in common law jurisdictions. 　Private individuals may create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that adopt alternative ways of resolving disputes to standard court litigation. 　The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. 　The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and also serves as a mediator of relations between people. 　Legal systems vary between jurisdictions, with their differences analysed in comparative law. 　In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law. 　In common law systems, judges may make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature. 　Historically, religious law has influenced secular matters and is, as of the 21st century, still in use in some religious communities. 　Sharia law based on Islamic principles is used as the primary legal system in several countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia. 　The scope of law can be divided into two domains. 　Public law concerns government and society, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law. 　Private law deals with legal disputes between individuals and/or organisations in areas such as contracts, property, torts/delicts and commercial law. 　This distinction is stronger in civil law countries, particularly those with a separate system of administrative courts; by contrast, the public-private law divide is less pronounced in common law jurisdictions. 　Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology. 　Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black>Black</a> </h2>
<p>Black is a color which results from the absence or complete absorption of visible light. 　It is an achromatic color, without hue, like white and grey. 　It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness. 　Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. 　Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason it is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates. 　Black was one of the first colors used by artists in Neolithic cave paintings. 　It was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as the color of the underworld. 　In the Roman Empire, it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil, witches, and magic. 　In the 14th century, it was worn by royalty, clergy, judges, and government officials in much of Europe. 　It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century. 　According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, fear, evil, and elegance. 　Black is the most common ink color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus is the easiest color to read. 　Similarly, black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens. 　As of September 2019, the darkest material is made by MIT engineers from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes.</p>

<p>A body (Latin: corpus) is the physical material of an organism. 　It is only used for organisms which are in one part or whole. 　There are organisms which change from single cells to whole organisms: for example, slime molds. 　For them the term 'body' would mean the multicellular stage. 　Other uses: Plant body: plants are modular , with modules being created by meristems and the body generally consisting of both the shoot system and the root system, with the body's development being influenced by its environment. 　Cell body: here it may be used for cells like neurons which have long axons (nerve fibres). 　The cell body is the part with the nucleus in it. 　The body of a dead person is also called a corpse or cadaver. 　The dead bodies of vertebrate animals and insects are sometimes called carcasses. 　The human body has a head, neck, torso, two arms, two legs and the genitals of the groin, which differ between males and females. 　The branch of biology dealing with the study of the bodies and their specific structural features called morphology. 　Anatomy is a branch of morphology that deals with the structure of the body at a level higher than tissue. 　Anatomy is closely related to histology, which studies the structure of tissues, as well as cytology, which studies the structure and function of the individual cells, from which the tissues and organs of the studied macroorganism are built. 　Taken together, anatomy, histology, cytology and embryology represent a morphology The study of functions and mechanisms in a body is physiology.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College>College</a> </h2>
<p>A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. 　A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, or a secondary school. 　In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. 　In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees. 　The word is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US. 　Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water>Water</a> </h2>
<p>Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. 　It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). 　It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food, energy or organic micronutrients. 　Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. 　The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°. 　"Water" is also the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard temperature and pressure. 　Because Earth's environment is relatively close to water's triple point, a number of natural states of water exist on earth. 　It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. 　Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. 　When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. 　The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. 　Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, with seas and oceans making up most of the water volume on earth (about 96.5%). 　Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%). 　Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. 　Water plays an important role in the world economy. 　Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture. 　Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world, providing 6.5% of global protein. 　Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. 　Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes. 　Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing. 　Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing.</p>
