<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden>Garden</a> </h2>
<p>A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. 　The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control. 　The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials. 　Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks. 　Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants. 　Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a market garden). 　Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses. 　The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one. 　Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens. 　Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden, which etymologically implies enclosure, often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden. 　Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, however, use plants sparsely or not at all. 　Landscape gardens, on the other hand, such as the English landscape gardens first developed in the 18th century, may omit flowers altogether. 　Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to engage in design at many scales and working on both public and private projects.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading>Reading</a> </h2>
<p>Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch. 　For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation. 　Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems. 　The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of braille).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference>Reference</a> </h2>
<p>Reference is a relationship between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. 　The first object in this relation is said to refer to the second object. 　It is called a name for the second object. 　The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the referent of the first object. 　A name is usually a phrase or expression, or some other symbolic representation. 　Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept. 　References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is audible (onomatopoeia), visual (text), olfactory, or tactile, emotional state, relationship with other, spacetime coordinate, symbolic or alpha-numeric, a physical object or an energy projection. 　In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in cryptography.　[citation needed] References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. 　Some of them are described in the sections below.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania>Pennsylvania</a> </h2>
<p>Pennsylvania (/ˌpɛnsɪlˈveɪniə/ (listen); Pennsylvania German: Pennsilfaani), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state spanning the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Appalachian, and Great Lakes regions of the United States. 　It borders Delaware to its southeast, Maryland to its south, West Virginia to its southwest, Ohio to its west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to its northwest, New York state to its north, and the Delaware River and New Jersey to its east. 　Pennsylvania is the fifth-most populous state in the nation with over 13 million residents as of 2020[update]. 　It is the 33rd-largest state by area and ranks ninth among all states in population density. 　The southeastern Delaware Valley metropolitan area comprises and surrounds Philadelphia, the state's largest and nation's sixth most populous city. 　Another 2.37 million reside in Greater Pittsburgh in the southwest, centered on Pittsburgh, the state's second-largest and Western Pennsylvania's largest city. 　The state's subsequent five most populous cities are: Allentown, Reading, Erie, Scranton, and Bethlehem. 　The state capital is Harrisburg. 　Pennsylvania's geography is highly diverse: the Appalachian Mountains run through the center of the state; the Allegheny and Pocono mountains span much of Northeast Pennsylvania; close to 60% of the state is forested. 　While it has only 140 miles (225 km) of waterfront along Lake Erie and the Delaware River, Pennsylvania has more navigable rivers than any other state in the nation, including the Delaware, Ohio, and Pine Creek rivers. 　Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 through a royal land grant to William Penn, son of the state's namesake; a southeast portion of the state was once part of the colony of New Sweden. 　Established as a haven for religious and political tolerance, the Province of Pennsylvania was known for its relatively peaceful relations with native tribes, innovative government system, and religious pluralism. 　Pennsylvania was one of thirteen British colonies from which the nation was formed. 　Pennsylvania played a vital and historic role in the American Revolution and the ultimately successful quest for independence from the British Empire. 　Its largest city, Philadelphia, was the gathering place of the nation's Founding Fathers and home to much of the thinking, activism, and writing that inspired the American Revolution. 　Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in Carpenters' Hall in 1774, and, beginning the following year, the Second Continental Congress in Independence Hall, which in 1776 unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, a document that historian Joseph Ellis has described as "the most potent and consequential words in American history" and which formally launched the American Revolutionary War. 　On December 25 and 26, 1776, Washington secretly led a column of Continental Army troops across the Delaware River from Bucks County, launching a successful surprise attack against Hessian mercenaries at the Battle of Trenton. 　In 1777 and 1778, the national capital of Philadelphia fell under British control for nine months, and multiple Revolutionary War battles were fought in Pennsylvania. 　For six months, Washington and 12,000 Continental Army troops encamped at Valley Forge over a harsh winter with limited supplies; roughly 1,700 to 2,000 of them died at Valley Forge from disease and malnutrition. 　In Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress, on June 21, 1778, ratified the Articles of Confederation, which served as the foundation for the ultimate development and ratification of the U.S. Constitution. 　On December 12, 1787, Pennsylvania became the second state after Delaware, which had previously been part of Pennsylvania as the three lower counties, to ratify the Constitution. 　On eight separate occasions prior to the construction of Washington, D.C. as the nation's capital, a Pennsylvania city served as the nation's capital. 　Philadelphia served as the nation's capital on six separate occasions, including from 1775 to 1776, in 1777, twice in 1778, in 1781, and from 1790 to 1800; York and Lancaster both briefly served as the nation's capital in 1777. 　During the American Civil War, Pennsylvania's 360,000 Union Army volunteers proved influential in strengthening the Union, successfully guarding the national capital of Washington, D.C., which was vulnerable following the fall of Fort Sumter, and later leading daring raids against Confederate Army strongholds in the Deep South. 　The bloodiest battle of the Civil War with over 50,000 casualties, and one of the Union Army's most important victories, was fought on Pennsylvania soil at Gettysburg over three days in July 1863. 　The Union Army's victory at Gettysburg is considered the turning point in the war, leading to the Union's preservation. 　President Abraham Lincoln's 271-word address dedicating Gettysburg National Cemetery on November 19, 1863, remains one of the best-known speeches in American history. 　In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, Bethlehem-based Bethlehem Steel, and other Pennsylvania manufacturing companies inspired the American Industrial Revolution and contributed to the development of much of the nation's early infrastructure, including key bridges, skyscrapers, and warships, tanks, and other military hardware used in U.S.-led victories in World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. 　Since Pennsylvania's 1787 founding, a number of influential Pennsylvanians have contributed significantly to the nation in many fields, including the military, politics, business, scientific innovation, thought leadership, philanthropy, music, art, and sports.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning>Planning</a> </h2>
<p>Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal. 　Planning is based on foresight, the fundamental capacity for mental time travel. 　The evolution of forethought, the capacity to think ahead, is considered to have been a prime mover in human evolution. 　Planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior. 　It involves the use of logic and imagination to visualise not only a desired end result, but the steps necessary to achieve that result. 　An important aspect of planning is its relationship to forecasting. 　Forecasting aims to predict what the future will look like, while planning imagines what the future could look like. 　Planning according to established principles is a core part of many professional occupations, particularly in fields such as management and business. 　Once a plan has been developed it is possible to measure and assess progress, efficiency and effectiveness. 　As circumstances change, plans may need to be modified or even abandoned.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map>Map</a> </h2>
<p>A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes. 　Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. 　Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping. 　The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables. 　Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. 　The word "map" comes from the medieval Latin: Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant 'napkin' or 'cloth' and mundi 'the world'. 　Thus, "map" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate>Senate</a> </h2>
<p>A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature. 　The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning "the elder" or "old man") and therefore considered wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class. 　However the Roman Senate was not the ancestor or predecessor of modern parliamentarism in any sense, because the Roman senate was not a legislative body. 　Many countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. 　Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of "sober second thought" to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected. 　Most senates have asymmetrical duties and powers compared with their respective lower house meaning they have special duties, for example to fill important political positions or to pass special laws. 　Conversely many senates have limited powers in changing or stopping bills under consideration and efforts to stall or veto a bill may be bypassed by the lower house or another branch of government.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning>Turning</a> </h2>
<p>Turning is a machining process in which a cutting tool, typically a non-rotary tool bit, describes a helix toolpath by moving more or less linearly while the workpiece rotates. 　Usually the term "turning" is reserved for the generation of external surfaces by this cutting action, whereas this same essential cutting action when applied to internal surfaces (holes, of one kind or another) is called "boring". 　Thus the phrase "turning and boring" categorizes the larger family of processes known as lathing. 　The cutting of faces on the workpiece, whether with a turning or boring tool, is called "facing", and may be lumped into either category as a subset. 　Turning can be done manually, in a traditional form of lathe, which frequently requires continuous supervision by the operator, or by using an automated lathe which does not. 　Today the most common type of such automation is computer numerical control, better known as CNC. 　(CNC is also commonly used with many other types of machining besides turning.) 　When turning, the workpiece (a piece of relatively rigid material such as wood, metal, plastic, or stone) is rotated and a cutting tool is traversed along 1, 2, or 3 axes of motion to produce precise diameters and depths. 　Turning can be either on the outside of the cylinder or on the inside (also known as boring) to produce tubular components to various geometries. 　Although now quite rare, early lathes could even be used to produce complex geometric figures, even the platonic solids; although since the advent of CNC it has become unusual to use non-computerized toolpath control for this purpose. 　The turning processes are typically carried out on a lathe, considered to be the oldest of machine tools, and can be of different types such as straight turning, taper turning, profiling or external grooving. 　Those types of turning processes can produce various shapes of materials such as straight, conical, curved, or grooved workpieces. 　In general, turning uses simple single-point cutting tools. 　Each group of workpiece materials has an optimum set of tool angles that have been developed through the years. 　The bits of waste metal from turning operations are known as chips (North America), or swarf (Britain). 　In some areas they may be known as turnings. 　The tool's axes of movement may be literally a straight line, or they may be along some set of curves or angles, but they are essentially linear (in the non mathematical sense). 　A component that is subject to turning operations can be termed as a “Turned Part” or “Machined Component”. 　Turning operations are carried out on a lathe machine which can be manually or CNC operated.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant>Lieutenant</a> </h2>
<p>A lieutenant (UK: /lɛfˈtɛnənt/ lef-TEN-ənt, US: /luːˈtɛnənt/ loo-TEN-ənt; abbreviated Lt., Lt, LT, Lieut and similar) is a commissioned officer rank in the armed forces of many nations. 　The meaning of lieutenant differs in different militaries (see comparative military ranks), but it is often subdivided into senior (first lieutenant) and junior (second lieutenant and even third lieutenant) ranks. 　In navies, it is often equivalent to the army rank of captain; it may also indicate a particular post rather than a rank. 　The rank is also used in fire services, emergency medical services, security services and police forces. 　Lieutenant may also appear as part of a title used in various other organisations with a codified command structure. 　It often designates someone who is "second-in-command", and as such, may precede the name of the rank directly above it. 　For example, a "lieutenant master" is likely to be second-in-command to the "master" in an organisation using both ranks. 　Political uses include lieutenant governor in various governments, such as the viceregal representatives of the Crown in Canadian provinces. 　In the United Kingdom, a lord lieutenant is the sovereign's representative in a county or lieutenancy area, while a deputy lieutenant is one of the lord lieutenant's deputies.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology)>Boundary (topology)</a> </h2>
<p>In topology and mathematics in general, the boundary of a subset S of a topological space X is the set of points in the closure of S not belonging to the interior of S. An element of the boundary of S is called a boundary point of S. The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set. 　Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd ⁡ ( S ) , fr ⁡ ( S ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {bd} (S),\operatorname {fr} (S),} and ∂ S {\displaystyle \partial S} . 　Some authors (for example Willard, in General Topology) use the term frontier instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with a different definition used in algebraic topology and the theory of manifolds. 　Despite widespread acceptance of the meaning of the terms boundary and frontier, they have sometimes been used to refer to other sets. 　For example, Metric Spaces by E. T. Copson uses the term boundary to refer to Hausdorff's border, which is defined as the intersection of a set with its boundary. 　Hausdorff also introduced the term residue, which is defined as the intersection of a set with the closure of the border of its complement. 　A connected component of the boundary of S is called a boundary component of S.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder>Murder</a> </h2>
<p>Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought. 　This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. 　Manslaughter is killing committed in the absence of malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. 　Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness. 　Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime, and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, or incapacitation. 　In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, a life sentence, or capital punishment.</p>

<p>In critical theory, sociology, and psychoanalysis, the gaze (French le regard), in the philosophical and figurative sense, is an individual's (or a group's) awareness and perception of other individuals, other groups, or oneself. 　The concept and the social applications of the gaze have been defined and explained by existentialist and phenomenologist philosophers. 　Jean-Paul Sartre described the gaze (or "the look") in Being and Nothingness (1943). 　Michel Foucault, in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (1975), developed the concept of the gaze to illustrate the dynamics of socio-political power relations and the social dynamics of society's mechanisms of discipline. 　Jacques Derrida, in The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Come) (1997), elaborated upon the inter-species relations that exist among human beings and other animals, which are established by way of the gaze.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie>Lie</a> </h2>
<p>A lie is an assertion that is believed to be false, typically used with the purpose of deceiving or misleading someone. 　The practice of communicating lies is called lying. 　A person who communicates a lie may be termed a liar. 　Lies can be interpreted as deliberately false statements or misleading statements. 　Lies may also serve a variety of instrumental, interpersonal, or psychological functions for the individuals who use them. 　Generally, the term "lie" carries a negative connotation, and depending on the context a person who communicates a lie may be subject to social, legal, religious, or criminal sanctions; for instance, perjury, or the act of lying under oath, can result in criminal and civil charges being pressed against the perjurer. 　Although people in many cultures believe that deception can be detected by observing nonverbal behaviors (e.g. not making eye contact, fidgeting, stuttering) research indicates that people overestimate both the significance of such cues and their ability to make accurate judgements about deception. 　More generally, people's ability to make true judgments is affected by biases towards accepting incoming information and interpreting feelings as evidence of truth. 　People do not always check incoming assertions against their memory.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease>Disease</a> </h2>
<p>A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury. 　Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms. 　A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. 　For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders. 　In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person affected, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. 　In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. 　Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life. 　Death due to disease is called death by natural causes. 　There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases. 　Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases. 　The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections. 　In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety. 　The study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause.</p>

<p>Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; Japanese: トゥワイス, Hepburn: To~uwaisu; commonly stylized as TWICE) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. 　The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. 　Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended play (EP) The Story Begins. 　Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single "Cheer Up", which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the best-performing single of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. 　Their next single, "TT", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. 　The EP was the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. 　Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four EPs and special album. 　As of December 2020, the group has sold over 15 million albums cumulatively in South Korea and Japan. 　The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice. 　The album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. 　It was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese maxi single titled "One More Time" in October. 　Twice became the first Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album and CD single in the same year. 　Twice ranked third in the Top Artist category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-end Rankings, and in 2019, they became the first Korean girl group to embark on a Japanese dome tour. 　Twice is the first female Korean act to simultaneously top both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales charts with the release of their first studio album Twicetagram and its lead single "Likey" in 2017. 　With the release of their single "Feel Special" in 2019, Twice became the third female Korean act to chart into the Canadian Hot 100. 　After signing with Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group has charted into the US Billboard 200 with More & More and Eyes Wide Open in 2020, Taste of Love and Formula of Love: O+T=<3 in 2021, and Between 1&2 in 2022. 　Their first official English-language single, "The Feels", became their first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the 83rd and 80th positions of the charts, respectively. 　They have been dubbed the next "Nation's Girl Group", and their point choreography—including for "Cheer Up" (2016), "TT" (2016), "Signal" (2017), and "What Is Love?" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss>Kiss</a> </h2>
<p>A kiss is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object. 　Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely. 　Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of love, passion, romance, sexual attraction, sexual activity, sexual arousal, affection, respect, greeting, peace, and good luck, among many others. 　In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or a sacramental. 　The word came from Old English cyssan ("to kiss"), in turn from coss ("a kiss").</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking>Walking</a> </h2>
<p>Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. 　Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. 　Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. 　This applies regardless of the usable number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.</p>
