<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement>Arrangement</a> </h2>
<p>In music, an arrangement is a musical adaptation of an existing composition. 　Differences from the original composition may include reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or formal development. 　Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. 　Arranging "involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings. Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety". 　In jazz, a memorized (unwritten) arrangement of a new or pre-existing composition is known as a head arrangement.</p>

<p>Tested is a live album by punk rock band Bad Religion. 　It was recorded in the USA, Canada, Germany, Estonia, Denmark, Italy and Austria, in 1996, and released in 1997. 　It is Bad Religion's second live album. 　Instead of using crowd microphones and mobile studios like most live albums, the band tapped the inputs, for a result that portrays Bad Religion's live sound without crowd noise. 　It also includes three new songs; "Dream of Unity," "It's Reciprocal," and the title track.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery>Monastery</a> </h2>
<p>A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). 　A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church, or temple, and may also serve as an oratory, or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. 　A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, dormitory, cloister, refectory, library, balneary and infirmary, and outlying granges. 　Depending on the location, the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community. 　These may include a hospice, a school, and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn, a forge, or a brewery. 　In English usage, the term monastery is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks. 　In modern usage, convent tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics (nuns), particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters. 　Historically, a convent denoted a house of friars (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a friary. 　Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource>Resource</a> </h2>
<p>Resource refers to all the materials available in our environment which are technologically accessible, economically feasible and culturally sustainable and help us to satisfy our needs and wants. 　Resources can broadly be classified upon their availability — they are classified into renewable and non-renewable resources. 　They can also be classified as actual and potential on the basis of the level of development and use, on the basis of origin they can be classified as biotic and abiotic, and on the basis of their distribution, as ubiquitous and localised (private, community-owned, national and international resources). 　An item becomes a resource with time and developing technology. 　The benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well-being. 　From a human perspective, a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. 　From a broader biological or ecological perspective, a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). 　The concept of resources has been developed across many established areas of work, in economics, biology and ecology, computer science, management, and human resources for example - linked to the concepts of competition, sustainability, conservation, and stewardship. 　In application within human society, commercial or non-commercial factors require resource allocation through resource management. 　The concept of a resource can also be tied to the direction of leadership over resources, this can include the things leaders have responsibility for over the human resources, with management, help, support or direction such as in charge of a professional group, technical experts, innovative leaders, archiving expertise, academic management, association management, business management, healthcare management, military management, public administration, spiritual leadership and social networking administrator.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi>Vi</a> </h2>
<p>vi (pronounced as distinct letters, /ˌviːˈaɪ/) is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. 　The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX. 　The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley. 　Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix release in March 1978. 　It was not until version 2.0 of ex, released as part of Second BSD in May 1979 that the editor was installed under the name "vi" (which took users straight into ex's visual mode), and the name by which it is known today. 　Some current implementations of vi can trace their source code ancestry to Bill Joy; others are completely new, largely compatible reimplementations.　[citation needed][discuss] The name "vi" is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the ex command visual, which switches the ex line editor to its full-screen mode. 　The name is pronounced /ˌviːˈaɪ/ (the English letters v and i). 　In addition to various non–free software variants of vi distributed with proprietary implementations of Unix, vi was opensourced with OpenSolaris, and several free and open source software vi clones exist. 　A 2009 survey of Linux Journal readers found that vi was the most widely used text editor among respondents, beating gedit, the second most widely used editor, by nearly a factor of two (36% to 19%).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey>Abbey</a> </h2>
<p>An abbey is a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess. 　Abbeys provide a complex of buildings and land for religious activities, work, and housing of Christian monks and nuns. 　The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. 　Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. 　An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. 　The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. 　Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted, or education to the young. 　Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. 　There are many famous abbeys across the Mediterranean Basin and Europe.</p>

<p>Coordinates: 47°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿47°N 20°E﻿ / 47; 20 Hungary (Hungarian: Magyarország [ˈmɒɟɒrorsaːɡ] (listen)) is a landlocked country in Central Europe. 　Spanning 93,030 square kilometres (35,920 sq mi) of the Carpathian Basin, it is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Ukraine to the northeast, Romania to the east and southeast, Serbia to the south, Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest, and Austria to the west. 　Hungary has a population of 9.7 million, mostly ethnic Hungarians and a significant Romani minority. 　Hungarian, the official language, is the world's most widely spoken Uralic language and among the few non-Indo-European languages widely spoken in Europe. 　Budapest is the country's capital and largest city; other major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs, and Győr. 　The territory of present-day Hungary has for centuries been a crossroads for various peoples, including Celts, Romans, Germanic tribes, Huns, West Slavs and the Avars. 　The foundation of the Hungarian state was established in the late 9th century AD with the conquest of the Carpathian Basin by Hungarian grand prince Árpád. 　His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000, converting his realm to a Christian kingdom. 　By the 12th century, Hungary became a regional power, reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century. 　Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, it was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire (1541–1699). 　Hungary came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century, later joining with the Austrian Empire to form Austria-Hungary, a major power into the early 20th century. 　Austria-Hungary collapsed after World War I, and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. 　Following the tumultuous interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. 　Postwar Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, leading to the establishment of the Hungarian People's Republic. 　Following the failed 1956 revolution, Hungary became a comparatively freer, though still repressed, member of the Eastern Bloc. 　The removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and subsequently the Soviet Union. 　On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic. 　Hungary joined the European Union in 2004 and has been part of the Schengen Area since 2007. 　Hungary is a middle power in international affairs, owing mostly to its cultural and economic influence. 　It is a high-income economy with a very high human development index, where citizens enjoy universal health care and tuition-free secondary education. 　Hungary has a long history of significant contributions to arts, music, literature, sports, science and technology. 　It is a popular tourist destination in Europe, drawing 24.5 million international tourists in 2019. 　It is a member of numerous international organisations, including the Council of Europe, NATO, United Nations, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Investment Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Visegrád Group.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb>Bomb</a> </h2>
<p>Look up bomb in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy. 　Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects. 　Bombs have been utilized since the 11th century starting in East Asia. 　The term bomb is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining, although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a "bomb". 　The military use of the term "bomb", or more specifically aerial bomb action, typically refers to airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by air forces and naval aviation. 　Other military explosive weapons not classified as "bombs" include shells, depth charges (used in water), or land mines. 　In unconventional warfare, other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry. 　For instance, in recent Middle Eastern conflicts, homemade bombs called "improvised explosive devices" (IEDs) have been employed by insurgent fighters to great effectiveness. 　The word comes from the Latin bombus, which in turn comes from the Greek βόμβος romanized bombos, an onomatopoetic term meaning 'booming', 'buzzing'.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting>Cutting</a> </h2>
<p>Cutting is the separation or opening of a physical object, into two or more portions, through the application of an acutely directed force. 　Implements commonly used for cutting are the knife and saw, or in medicine and science the scalpel and microtome. 　However, any sufficiently sharp object is capable of cutting if it has a hardness sufficiently larger than the object being cut, and if it is applied with sufficient force. 　Even liquids can be used to cut things when applied with sufficient force (see water jet cutter). 　Cutting is a compressive and shearing phenomenon, and occurs only when the total stress generated by the cutting implement exceeds the ultimate strength of the material of the object being cut. 　The simplest applicable equation is: stress = force area {\displaystyle {\text{stress}}={{\text{force}} \over {\text{area}}}} or τ = F A {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {F}{A}}} The stress generated by a cutting implement is directly proportional to the force with which it is applied, and inversely proportional to the area of contact. 　Hence, the smaller the area (i.e., the sharper the cutting implement), the less force is needed to cut something. 　It is generally seen that cutting edges are thinner for cutting soft materials and thicker for harder materials. 　This progression is seen from kitchen knife, to cleaver, to axe, and is a balance between the easy cutting action of a thin blade vs strength and edge durability of a thicker blade.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix>Prix</a> </h2>
<p>Prix was an American power pop band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1975 by Tommy Hoehn and Jon Tiven. 　The group ended up primarily as a studio project. 　Its recordings were produced by Tiven along with former Big Star member Chris Bell, who also played guitar and sang backup vocals. 　Prix is also famous of Banjo playing. 　Alex Chilton also participated in the recordings, along with session drummer Hilly Michaels. 　Although the group generated some major record label interest—notably from Mercury Records and Columbia/CBS Records—it ultimately only released a double A-side single on Ork Records in 1977 and a single on Miracle Records in 1978. 　Its only live performance came at a CBS Records showcase in 1976. 　In 1977, just as Ork Records released the first single and booked the group at CBGB, Prix broke up due both to Hoehn's unwillingness to remain in New York and to creative differences. 　In 1978, two of the songs recorded during the Prix sessions were included on Losing You to Sleep, Hoehn's major label solo debut on London Records. 　In 2002, the Japanese label Air Mail Music released Historix, a CD-only collection of all eleven songs recorded by Prix, plus four alternate versions. 　Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the songs as "11 sparkling, diamond-hard pop gems that will prove to be irresistible to power pop fanatics." 　In 2015, six of the songs were released on the compilation Ork Records: New York, New York. 　In 2016, HoZac Records re-released Historix on vinyl and CD.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic>Pandemic</a> </h2>
<p>A pandemic (/pænˈdɛmɪk/ pan-DEM-ik) is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of individuals. 　A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected individuals is not a pandemic. 　Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected individuals such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide. 　Throughout human history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as smallpox. 　The most fatal pandemic in recorded history was the Black Death—also known as The Plague—which killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century. 　The term had not been used then but was used for later epidemics, including the 1918 influenza pandemic—more commonly known as the Spanish flu. 　Current pandemics include HIV/AIDS and COVID-19.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy>Trophy</a> </h2>
<p>A trophy is a tangible, durable reminder of a specific achievement, and serves as a recognition or evidence of merit. 　Trophies are often awarded for sporting events, from youth sports to professional level athletics. 　In many sports medals (or, in North America, rings) are often given out either as the trophy or along with more traditional trophies. 　Originally the word trophy, derived from the Greek tropaion, referred to arms, standards, other property, or human captives and body parts (e.g., headhunting) captured in battle. 　These war trophies commemorated the military victories of a state, army or individual combatant. 　In modern warfare trophy taking is discouraged, but this sense of the word is reflected in hunting trophies and human trophy collecting by serial killers.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation>Explanation</a> </h2>
<p>An explanation is a set of statements usually constructed to describe a set of facts which clarifies the causes, context, and consequences of those facts. 　It may establish rules or laws, and may clarify the existing rules or laws in relation to any objects or phenomena examined. 　Explanation, in philosophy, is a set of statements that makes intelligible the existence or occurrence of an object, event, or state of affairs. 　Among its most common forms are: Causal explanation Deductive-nomological explanation, which involves subsuming the explanandum under a generalization from which it may be derived in a deductive argument (e.g., “All gases expand when heated; this gas was heated; therefore, this gas expanded”) Statistical explanation, which involves subsuming the explanandum under a generalization that gives it inductive support (e.g., “Most people who use tobacco contract cancer; this person used tobacco; therefore, this person contracted cancer”). 　Explanations of human behaviour typically appeal to the subject’s beliefs and desires, as well as other facts about him, and proceed on the assumption that the behaviour in question is rational (at least to a minimum degree). 　Thus an explanation of why the subject removed his coat might cite the fact that the subject felt hot, that the subject desired to feel cooler, and that the subject believed that he would feel cooler if he took off his coat.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty>Liberty</a> </h2>
<p>Liberty is the ability to do as one pleases, or a right or immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant (i.e. privilege). 　It is a synonym for the word freedom. 　In modern politics, liberty is understood as the state of being free within society from control or oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views. 　In theology, liberty is freedom from the effects of "sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties". 　Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word "freedom" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word "liberty" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. 　In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. 　Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. 　Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. 　In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts. 　Liberty originates from the Latin word libertas, derived from the name of the goddess Libertas, who, along with more modern personifications, is often used to portray the concept, and the archaic Roman god Liber.　[citation needed] The word "liberty" is often used in slogans, such as in "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" and "Liberté, égalité, fraternité".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible>Bible</a> </h2>
<p>The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, 'the books') is a collection of religious texts or scriptures that are held to be sacred in Christianity, Judaism, Samaritanism, and many other religions. 　The Bible is an anthology – a compilation of texts of a variety of forms – originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. 　These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophecies, among other genres. 　The collection of materials that are accepted as part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon. 　Believers in the Bible generally consider it to be a product of divine inspiration, but the way they understand what that means and interpret the text can vary. 　The religious texts were compiled by different religious communities into various official collections. 　The earliest contained the first five books of the Bible. 　It is called the Torah in Hebrew and the Pentateuch (meaning five books) in Greek; the second oldest part was a collection of narrative histories and prophecies (the Nevi'im); the third collection (the Ketuvim) contains psalms, proverbs, and narrative histories. 　"Tanakh" is an alternate term for the Hebrew Bible composed of the first letters of those three parts of the Hebrew scriptures: the Torah ("Teaching"), the Nevi'im ("Prophets"), and the Ketuvim ("Writings"). 　The Masoretic Text is the medieval version of the Tanakh, in Hebrew and Aramaic, that is considered the authoritative text of the Hebrew Bible by modern Rabbinic Judaism. 　The Septuagint (meaning the Translation of the Seventy) is a Koine Greek translation of the Tanakh from the third and second centuries BCE (Before Common Era); it largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible. 　Christianity began as an outgrowth of Judaism, using the Septuagint as the basis of the Old Testament. 　The early Church continued the Jewish tradition of writing and incorporating what it saw as inspired, authoritative religious books. 　The gospels, Pauline epistles and other texts quickly coalesced into the New Testament. 　With estimated total sales of over five billion copies, the Bible is the best-selling publication of all time. 　It has had a profound influence both on Western culture and history and on cultures around the globe. 　The study of it through biblical criticism has indirectly impacted culture and history as well. 　The Bible is currently translated or being translated into about half of the world's languages.</p>
