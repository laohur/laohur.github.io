<p>A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance. 　Some of the first monuments were dolmens or menhirs, megalithic constructions built for religious or funerary purposes. 　Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets. 　If there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio>Antonio</a> </h2>
<p>Antonio is a masculine given name of Etruscan origin deriving from the root name Antonius. 　It is a common name among Romance language–speaking populations as well as the Balkans and Lusophone Africa. 　It has been among the top 400 most popular male baby names in the United States since the late 19th century and has been among the top 200 since the mid 20th century. 　In the English language it is translated as Anthony, and has some female derivatives: Antonia, Antónia, Antonieta, Antonietta, and Antonella'. 　It also has some male derivatives, such as Anthonio, Antón, Antò, Antonis, Antoñito, Antonino, Antonello, Tonio, Tono, Toño, Toñín, Tonino, Nantonio, Ninni, Totò, Tó, Tonini, Tony, Toni, Toninho, Toñito, and Tõnis. 　The Portuguese equivalent is António (Portuguese orthography) or Antônio (Brazilian Portuguese). 　In old Portuguese the form Antão was also used, not just to differentiate between older and younger but also between more and less important.　[citation needed] In Galician the form is Antón, in Catalan Antò, and in Basque Antxon. 　The Greek versions of the name are Antonios (Αντώνιος) and Antonis (Αντώνης). 　The name derives from Antonius, a well-known Latin family name, probably of Etruscan origin. 　The Roman general Marcus Antonius held that the origin of the name was Anthon (Ανθών), son of Hercules. 　This myth, recorded by Plutarch, was probably created by Marcus Antonius himself, in order to claim divine parentage. 　The name was in use throughout the Roman world which, at its height, comprised the whole of the Mediterranean and much of Europe as well as the Middle East. 　When the Roman Empire became Christian, the name continued in popularity because of the many great saints who bore the name. 　Later, the name was spread all around the world as Christianity was introduced to other locations (e.g. the Far East, the Americas, Australia, and Sub-Saharan Africa).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi>Mississippi</a> </h2>
<p>Mississippi (/ˌmɪsɪˈsɪpi/ (listen)) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the north by Tennessee; to the east by Alabama; to the south by the Gulf of Mexico; to the southwest by Louisiana; and to the northwest by Arkansas. 　Mississippi's western boundary is largely defined by the Mississippi River. 　Mississippi is the 32nd largest and 35th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states and has the lowest per-capita income in the United States. 　Jackson is both the state's capital and largest city. 　Greater Jackson is the state's most populous metropolitan area, with a population of 591,978 in 2020. 　On December 10, 1817, Mississippi became the 20th state admitted to the Union. 　By 1860, Mississippi was the nation's top cotton-producing state and slaves accounted for 55% of the state population. 　Mississippi declared its secession from the Union on January 9, 1861, and was one of the seven original Confederate States, which constituted the largest slaveholding states in the nation. 　Following the Civil War, it was restored to the Union on February 23, 1870. 　Until the Great Migration of the 1930s, African Americans were a majority of Mississippi's population. 　In 2020, 37.6% of Mississippi's population was African American, the highest percentage of any state. 　Mississippi was the site of many prominent events during the civil rights movement, including the Ole Miss riot of 1962 by white students objecting to desegregation, the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, and the 1964 Freedom Summer murders of three activists working on voting rights. 　Mississippi frequently ranks low among U.S. states in measures of health, education, and development, while ranking high in measures of poverty. 　Top economic industries in Mississippi today are agriculture and forestry. 　Mississippi produces more than half of the country's farm-raised catfish, and is also a top producer of sweet potatoes, cotton and pulpwood. 　Other main industries in Mississippi include advanced manufacturing, utilities, transportation, and health services. 　Mississippi is almost entirely within the Gulf coastal plain, and generally consists of lowland plains and low hills. 　The northwest remainder of the state consists of the Mississippi Delta, a section of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. 　Mississippi's highest point is Woodall Mountain at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the Cumberland Plateau; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. 　Mississippi has a humid subtropical climate classification.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document>Document</a> </h2>
<p>A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought, often the manifestation of non-fictional, as well as fictional, content. 　The word originates from the Latin Documentumcode: lat promoted to code: la , which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doceōcode: lat promoted to code: la denotes "to teach". 　In the past, the word was usually used to denote written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. 　In the Computer Age, "document" usually denotes a primarily textual computer file, including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and images. 　Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its transmission medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents. 　"Documentation" is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". 　Documents are also distinguished from "realia", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2-dimensional representations. 　While documents can have large varieties of customization, all documents can be shared freely and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. 　History, events, examples, opinions, etc. all can be expressed in documents.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin>Twin</a> </h2>
<p>Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy. 　Twins can be either monozygotic ('identical'), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic ('non-identical' or 'fraternal'), meaning that each twin develops from a separate egg and each egg is fertilized by its own sperm cell. 　Since identical twins develop from one zygote, they will share the same sex, while fraternal twins may or may not. 　In rare cases twins can have the same mother and different fathers (heteropaternal superfecundation). 　In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb (the much more common case, in humans) is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is a multiple. 　Unrelated look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgängers.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism>Criticism</a> </h2>
<p>Criticism is the construction of a judgement about the negative qualities of someone or something. 　Criticism can range from impromptu comments to a written detailed response. 　Criticism falls into several overlapping types including "theoretical, practical, impressionistic, affective, prescriptive, or descriptive". 　Criticism may also refer to an expression of disapproval. 　When criticism of this nature is constructive it can make an individual aware of gaps in their understanding and it can provide distinct routes for improvement. 　Research supports the notion that using feedback and constructive criticism in the learning process is very influential. 　Critique vs criticism In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and 'criticism'. 　The two words both translate as critique, Kritik, and critica, respectively. 　In the English language, philosopher Gianni Vattimo suggests that criticism is used more frequently to denote literary criticism or art criticism while critique refers to more general and profound writing as Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. 　Another distinction that is sometimes made is that critique is never personalized nor ad hominem and is presented in a way that encourages rebuttal or expansion of the ideas expressed. 　Nonetheless, the distinctions are subtle and ambiguous at best. 　The term "brickbat" is sometimes used to mean "an unfavourable criticism, unkind remark or sharp put-down". 　The term originated in the 17th century, derived from the practice of throwing bricks as projectiles at a person who was disapproved of. 　In some contexts, such as literary criticism and art criticism, the word criticism is used as a neutral word that is synonymous with evaluation.</p>

<p>Smoke is a suspension of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. 　It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). 　It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes. 　It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative. 　Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. 　The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products. 　Smoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing>Breathing</a> </h2>
<p>Breathing (or ventilation) is the process of moving air into and from the lungs to facilitate gas exchange with the internal environment, mostly to flush out carbon dioxide and bring in oxygen. 　All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts energy from the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. 　Breathing, or "external respiration", brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the alveoli through diffusion. 　The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the cells, where "cellular respiration" takes place. 　The breathing of all vertebrates with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly branched system of tubes or airways which lead from the nose to the alveoli. 　The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate, and is one of the four primary vital signs of life. 　Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant. 　Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids (ECF). 　Over-breathing (hyperventilation) and under-breathing (hypoventilation), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. 　Both cause distressing symptoms. 　Breathing has other important functions. 　It provides a mechanism for speech, laughter and similar expressions of the emotions. 　It is also used for reflexes such as yawning, coughing and sneezing. 　Animals that cannot thermoregulate by perspiration, because they lack sufficient sweat glands, may lose heat by evaporation through panting.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega>Omega</a> </h2>
<p>Omega (/oʊˈmiːɡə, oʊˈmɛɡə, oʊˈmeɪɡə, əˈmiːɡə/; capital: Ω, lowercase: ω; Ancient Greek ὦ, later ὦ μέγα, Modern Greek ωμέγα) is the twenty-fourth and final letter in the Greek alphabet. 　In the Greek numeric system/isopsephy (gematria), it has a value of 800. 　The word literally means "great O" (ō mega, mega meaning "great"), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (o mikron, micron meaning "little"). 　In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω represented a long open-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [ɔː], comparable to the "aw" of the English word raw in dialects without the cot–caught merger, in contrast to omicron which represented the close-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [o] , and the digraph ου which represented the long close-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [oː]. 　In Modern Greek, both omega and omicron represent the mid back rounded vowel IPA: [o̞] or IPA: [ɔ̝]. 　The letter omega is transliterated into a Latin-script alphabet as ō or simply o. 　As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see Alpha and Omega.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering>Suffering</a> </h2>
<p>Suffering, or pain in a broad sense, may be an experience of unpleasantness or aversion, possibly associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual. 　Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena. 　The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness. 　Suffering is often categorized as physical or mental. 　It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. 　Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. 　Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved. 　Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. 　As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. 　These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.</p>

<p>The reputation of a social entity (a person, a social group, an organization, or a place) is an opinion about that entity typically as a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria, such as behavior or performance. 　Reputation is a ubiquitous, spontaneous, and highly efficient mechanism of social control. 　It is a subject of study in social, management, and technological sciences. 　Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organizations, institutions and communities. 　Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. 　At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). 　It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. 　Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control. 　The concept of reputation is considered important in business, politics, education, online communities, and many other fields, and it may be considered as a reflection of that social entity's identity.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot>Shoot</a> </h2>
<p>In botany, a plant shoot consists of any plant stem together with its appendages, leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems, and flower buds. 　The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. 　In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants. 　In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems. 　Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves. 　Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest. 　As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure. 　Some plants (e.g. bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable. 　The shoot of a cucumber Edible shoots of Sachaline Sunflower seedlings germinate A young hass avocado shoot</p>

<p>Coordinates: 33°N 44°E﻿ / ﻿33°N 44°E﻿ / 33; 44 Iraq, officially the Republic of Iraq, is a country in Western Asia. 　It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, the Persian Gulf and Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest and Syria to the west. 　The capital and largest city is Baghdad. 　Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Iraqi Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Armenians, Yazidis, Mandaeans, Persians and Shabakis with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. 　The majority of the country's 40 million residents are Muslims – the notable other faiths are Christianity, Yazidism, Mandaeism, Yarsanism and Zoroastrianism. 　The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish; others also recognised in specific regions are Suret (Assyrian), Turkish and Armenian. 　Starting as early as the 6th millennium BC, the fertile alluvial plains between Iraq's Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, referred to as Mesopotamia, gave rise to some of the world's earliest cities, civilisations, and empires ofthe indigenous Mesopotamians in Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria. 　Mesopotamia was a "Cradle of Civilisation" that saw the independent development of a writing system, mathematics, timekeeping, a calendar, astrology, and a law code. 　Following the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia, Baghdad became the capital and the largest city of the Abbasid Caliphate, and during the Islamic Golden Age, the city evolved into a significant cultural and intellectual center, and garnered it a worldwide reputation for its academic institutions, including House of Wisdom. 　The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258 during the siege of Baghdad, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. 　Modern Iraq dates back to 1920, when the British Mandate for Mesopotamia, joining three Ottoman vilayets, was created under the authority of the League of Nations. 　A British-backed Kingdom was established in 1921 under Faisal I of Iraq. 　The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from the UK in 1932. 　In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Iraqi Republic created. 　Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. 　In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, sparking a protracted war which would last for almost eight years, and end in a stalemate with devastating losses for both countries. 　After an invasion by the United States and its allies in 2003, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power, and multi-party parliamentary elections were held in 2005. 　The US presence in Iraq ended in 2011. 　Iraq is a federal parliamentary republic. 　The president is the head of state, the prime minister is the head of government, and the constitution provides for two deliberative bodies, the Council of Representatives and the Council of Union. 　The judiciary is free and independent of the executive and the legislature. 　Iraq is considered an emerging middle power with a strategic location and a founding member of the United Nations, the OPEC as well as of the Arab League, OIC, Non-Aligned Movement and the IMF. 　From 1920 to 2005 Iraq experienced spells of significant economic and military growth and briefer instability including wars. 　Since the inception of the current multipartite system in 2005, the country has seen further growth and steadier international investment, and a major decline in factional domestic attacks.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer>Beer</a> </h2>
<p>Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed type of alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after potable water and tea. 　It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. 　During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. 　Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. 　Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. 　In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation. 　Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. 　Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. 　The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. 　The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above. 　Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling, pub quizzes and pub games. 　When beer is distilled, the resulting liquor is a form of whisky.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry>Geometry</a> </h2>
<p>Geometry (from Ancient Greek γεωμετρία (geōmetría) 'land measurement'; from γῆ (gê) 'earth, land', and μέτρον (métron) 'a measure')[citation needed] is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. 　It is concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. 　A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. 　Until the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts. 　During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. 　One of the oldest such discoveries is Carl Friedrich Gauss' Theorema Egregiumcode: lat promoted to code: la ("remarkable theorem") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. 　This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry. 　Later in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. 　The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry. 　Since then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.　—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others. 　Originally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. 　Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. 　For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.</p>

<p>A ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either "ranked higher than", "ranked lower than" or "ranked equal to" the second. 　In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects. 　It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. 　The rankings themselves are totally ordered. 　For example, materials are totally preordered by hardness, while degrees of hardness are totally ordered. 　If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie. 　By reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers, rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria. 　Thus, for example, an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their relevance, making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see. 　Analysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non-parametric statistics.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)>Stress (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>Stress, either physiological, biological or psychological, is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. 　Stress is the body's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. 　There are two hormones that an individual produces during a stressful situation, these are well known as adrenaline and cortisol. 　There are two kinds of stress hormone levels. 　Resting (basal) cortisol levels are normal everyday quantities that are essential for standard functioning. 　Reactive cortisol levels are increases in cortisol in response to stressors. 　Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body. 　In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress. 　The sympathoadrenal medullary (SAM) axis may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system, which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress, while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis. 　The second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, regulates the release of cortisol, which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions. 　The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and stria terminalis. 　Through these mechanisms, stress can alter memory functions, reward, immune function, metabolism and susceptibility to diseases. 　Disease risk is particularly pertinent to mental illnesses, whereby chronic or severe stress remains a common risk factor for several mental illnesses.</p>
