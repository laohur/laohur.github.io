<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention>Intention</a> </h2>
<p>Intentions are mental states in which the agent commits themselves to a course of action. 　Having the plan to visit the zoo tomorrow is an example of an intention. 　The action plan is the content of the intention while the commitment is the attitude towards this content. 　Other mental states can have action plans as their content, as when one admires a plan, but differ from intentions since they do not involve a practical commitment to realizing this plan. 　Successful intentions bring about the intended course of action while unsuccessful intentions fail to do so. 　Intentions, like many other mental states, have intentionality: they represent possible states of affairs. 　Theories of intention try to capture the characteristic features of intentions. 　The belief-desire theory is the traditionally dominant approach. 　According to a simple version of it, having an intention is nothing but having a desire to perform a certain action and a belief that one will perform this action. 　Belief-desire theories are frequently criticized based on the fact that neither beliefs nor desires involve a practical commitment to performing an action, which is often illustrated in various counterexamples. 　The evaluation theory tries to overcome this problem by explaining intentions in terms of unconditional evaluations. 　That is to say that intentions do not just present the intended course of action as good in some respect, as is the case for desires, but as good all things considered. 　This approach has problems in explaining cases of akrasia, i.e. that agents do not always intend what they see as the best course of action. 　A closely related theory identifies intentions not with unconditional evaluations but with predominant desires. 　It states that intending to do something consists in desiring it the most. 　Opponents of this approach have articulated various counterexamples with the goal of showing that intentions do not always coincide with the agent's strongest desire. 　A different approach to the theories mentioned so far is due to Elizabeth Anscombe and denies the distinction between intentions and actions. 　On her view, to intend a goal is already a form of acting towards this goal and therefore not a distinct mental state. 　This account struggles to explain cases in which intentions and actions seem to come apart, as when the agent is not currently doing anything towards realizing their plan or in the case of failed actions. 　The self-referentiality theory suggests that intentions are self-referential, i.e. that they do not just represent the intended course of action but also represent themselves as the cause of the action. 　But the claim that this happens on the level of the content of the intention has been contested. 　The term "intention" refers to a group of related phenomena. 　For this reason, theorists often distinguish various types of intentions in order to avoid misunderstandings. 　The most-discussed distinction is that between prospective and immediate intentions. 　Prospective intentions, also known as "prior intentions", involve plans for the future. 　They can be subdivided according to how far they plan ahead: proximal intentions involve plans for what one wants to do straightaway whereas distal intentions are concerned with a more remote future. 　Immediate intentions, on the other hand, are intentions that guide the agent while they are performing the action in question. 　They are also called "intentions-in-action" or "act-related" intentions. 　The term "intention" usually refers to anticipated means or ends that motivate the agent. 　But in some cases, it can refer to anticipated side-effects that are neither means nor ends to the agent. 　In this case, the term "oblique intention" is sometimes used. 　Intentions are rationally evaluable: they are either rational or irrational. 　Conscious intentions are the paradigmatic form of intention: in them, the agent is aware of their goals. 　But it has been suggested that actions can also be guided by unconscious intentions of which the agent is not aware. 　The formation of intentions is sometimes preceded by the deliberation of promising alternative courses of action and may happen in decisions, in which the agent chooses between these alternatives. 　Intentions are responsible for initiating, sustaining, and terminating actions and are frequently used to explain why people engage in a certain behavior. 　Understanding the behavior of others in terms of intentions already happens in early childhood. 　Important in this context is the role of gestures, pointing, attention, and eye movement to understand the intentions of others and to form shared intentions. 　In the philosophy of action, a central question is whether it is true for all intentional actions that they are caused or accompanied by intentions. 　The theory of reasoned action aims to predict behavior based on how pre-existing attitudes and subjective norms determine behavioral intentions. 　In ethics, the intention principle states that whether an action is morally permissible sometimes depends on the agent's intention for performing this action.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter>Charter</a> </h2>
<p>A charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. 　It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and it is that sense which is retained in modern usage of the term. 　The word entered the English language from the Old French charte, via Latin chartacode: lat promoted to code: la , and ultimately from Greek χάρτης (khartes, meaning "layer of papyrus"). 　It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule>Schedule</a> </h2>
<p>A schedule or a timetable, as a basic time-management tool, consists of a list of times at which possible tasks, events, or actions are intended to take place, or of a sequence of events in the chronological order in which such things are intended to take place. 　The process of creating a schedule — deciding how to order these tasks and how to commit resources between the variety of possible tasks — is called scheduling, and a person responsible for making a particular schedule may be called a scheduler. 　Making and following schedules is an ancient human activity. 　Some scenarios associate this kind of planning with learning life skills. 　Schedules are necessary, or at least useful, in situations where individuals need to know what time they must be at a specific location to receive a specific service, and where people need to accomplish a set of goals within a set time period. 　Schedules can usefully span both short periods, such as a daily or weekly schedule, and long-term planning with respect to periods of several months or years. 　They are often made using a calendar, where the person making the schedule can note the dates and times at which various events are planned to occur. 　Schedules that do not set forth specific times for events to occur may instead list algorithmically an expected order in which events either can or must take place. 　In some situations, schedules can be uncertain, such as where the conduct of daily life relies on environmental factors outside human control. 　People who are vacationing or otherwise seeking to reduce stress and achieve relaxation may intentionally avoid having a schedule for a certain period of time.</p>

<p>An aunt is a woman who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent. 　Aunts who are related by birth are second-degree relatives. 　Alternate terms include auntie or aunty. 　Children in other cultures and families may refer to the cousins of their parents as aunt or uncle due to the age and generation gap. 　The word comes from Latin: amita via Old French ante and is a family relationship within an extended or immediate family. 　The male counterpart of an aunt is an uncle, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing>Marketing</a> </h2>
<p>Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging attractive to buyers; defining the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. 　Marketing is typically done by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. 　Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. 　More rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination. 　It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. 　Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing). 　Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. 　Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers approach the planning stage of marketing. 　The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research, and the characteristics of the product's target market. 　Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements. 　The term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers' needs and wants.</p>

<p>Voting is a method by which a group, such as a meeting or an electorate, can convene together for the purpose of making a collective decision or expressing an opinion usually following discussions, debates or election campaigns. 　Democracies elect holders of high office by voting. 　Residents of a jurisdiction represented by an elected official are called "constituents," and the constituents who choose to cast a ballot for their chosen candidate are called "voters". 　There are different systems for collecting votes, but while many of the systems used in decision-making can also be used as electoral systems, any which cater for proportional representation can only be used in elections. 　In smaller organizations, voting can occur in many different ways. 　Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. 　Informally voting could occur as a spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand or electronically.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut>Connecticut</a> </h2>
<p>Connecticut (/kəˈnɛtɪkət/ (listen)) is the southernmost state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. 　Its capital is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. 　Historically, the state is part of New England as well as the tri-state area with New York and New Jersey. 　The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state. 　The word "Connecticut" is derived from various anglicized spellings of "Quinnetuket”, a Mohegan-Pequot word for "long tidal river". Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called House of Hope in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially claimed by the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders, considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony. Connecticut was one of the Thirteen Colonies which rejected British rule in the American Revolution. It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States. Connecticut is the third smallest state by area, the 29th most populous, and the fourth most densely populated of the fifty states.

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark>Denmark</a> </h2>
<p>Coordinates: 56°N 10°E﻿ / ﻿56°N 10°E﻿ / 56; 10 Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk] (listen)) is a Nordic constituent country in Northern Europe. 　It is the most populous and politically central constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean. 　Metropolitan Denmark is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying south-west of Sweden, south of Norway, and north of Germany. 　As of 2013, the Kingdom of Denmark, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, has a total of 1,419 islands above 100 square metres (1,100 sq ft); 443 of which have been named and of which 78 are inhabited. 　Spanning a total area of 42,943 km2 (16,580 sq mi), metropolitan Denmark consists of the northern part of the Jutland peninsula and an archipelago of 406 islands. 　Of these, the most populated island is Zealand, on which the capital Copenhagen is situated, followed by Funen, the North Jutlandic Island, and Amager. 　Denmark's geography is characterised by flat, arable land, sandy coasts, low elevation, and a temperate climate. 　As of 2022, it had a population of 5.928 million (1 October 2022), of which 800,000 live in the capital and largest city, Copenhagen. 　Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. 　Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948 and in Greenland in 1979; the latter obtained further autonomy in 2009. 　The unified Kingdom of Denmark emerged in the eighth century as a proficient maritime power amid the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. 　In 1397, it joined Norway and Sweden to form the Kalmar Union, which persisted until the latter's secession in 1523. 　The remaining Kingdom of Denmark–Norway endured a series of wars in the 17th century that resulted in further territorial cessions to the Swedish Empire. 　Following the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was absorbed into Sweden, leaving Denmark with the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. 　A surge of nationalist movements in the 19th century were defeated in the First Schleswig War of 1848, though the Second Schleswig War of 1864 resulted in further territorial losses to Prussia. 　The period saw the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy that was established in 1660 and introducing the current parliamentary system. 　An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century, which formed the basis for the present welfare state model and advanced mixed economy. 　Denmark remained neutral during World War I but regained the northern half of Schleswig in 1920. 　Danish neutrality was violated in World War II following a swift German invasion in April 1940. 　During occupation, a resistance movement emerged in 1943 while Iceland declared independence in 1944; Denmark was liberated in May 1945. 　In 1973, Denmark, together with Greenland but not the Faroes, became a member of what is now the European Union, but negotiated certain opt-outs, such as retaining its own currency, the krone. 　Denmark is a highly developed country with a high standard of living: the country performs at or near the top in measures of education, health care, civil liberties, democratic governance and LGBT equality. 　Denmark is a founding member of NATO, the Nordic Council, the OECD, OSCE, and the United Nations; it is also part of the Schengen Area. 　Denmark maintains close political, cultural, and linguistic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours, with the Danish language being partially mutually intelligible with both Norwegian and Swedish.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listening>Listening</a> </h2>
<p>Listening is giving attention to a sound or action. 　When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. 　The act of listening involves complex affective, cognitive and behavioral processes. 　Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. 　Listening is a skill for creating problems. 　Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or a dispute. 　Other causes can be excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, and having a closed mind. 　Listening is also linked to memory. 　According to one study, during a speech some background noises heard by listeners helped them recall some of the information by hearing it again. 　For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. 　Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting the cross-culture communicative discourses. 　Ratcliffe built her argument upon two incidents in which individuals demonstrated a tendency to refuse the cross-cultural discourses.</p>

<p>A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. 　Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage. 　Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g. Christmas, Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami). 　There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate: the former, except for February 29, occurs each year (e.g. January 15), while the latter is the complete date when a person was born (e.g. January 15, 2001).</p>

<p>Detroit (/dəˈtrɔɪt/ də-TROYT, locally also /ˈdiːtrɔɪt/ DEE-troyt; French: Détroit, lit. 'strait') is the largest city in the U.S. state of Michigan. 　It is also the largest U.S. city on the United States–Canada border, and the seat of government of Wayne County. 　The City of Detroit had a population of 639,111 at the 2020 census, making it the 27th-most populous city in the United States. 　The metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 4.3 million people, making it the second-largest in the Midwest after the Chicago metropolitan area, and the 14th-largest in the United States. 　Regarded as a major cultural center, Detroit is known for its contributions to music, art, architecture and design, in addition to its historical automotive background. 　Time named Detroit as one of the fifty World's Greatest Places of 2022 to explore. 　Detroit is a major port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 　The City of Detroit anchors the third-largest regional economy in the Midwest, behind Chicago and Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and the 16th-largest in the United States. 　Detroit is best known as the center of the U.S. automobile industry, and the "Big Three" auto manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis North America (Chrysler) are all headquartered in Metro Detroit. 　As of 2007[update], the Detroit metropolitan area is the number one exporting region among 310 defined metropolitan areas in the United States. 　The Detroit Metropolitan Airport is among the most important hub airports in the United States. 　Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor are connected through a highway tunnel, railway tunnel, and the Ambassador Bridge, which is the second-busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego–Tijuana. 　Both cities will soon be connected by a new bridge currently under construction, the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will provide a complete freeway-to-freeway link. 　The new bridge is expected to be open by 2024. 　In 1701, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and Alphonse de Tonty founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, the future city of Detroit. 　During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region. 　The city's population became the fourth-largest in the nation in 1920, after only New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia, with the expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century. 　As Detroit's industrialization took off, the Detroit River became the busiest commercial hub in the world. 　The strait carried over 65 million tons of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world each year; the freight throughput was more than three times that of New York and about four times that of London. 　By the 1940s, the city's population remained the fourth-largest in the country. 　However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid suburbanization, among other reasons, Detroit entered a state of urban decay and lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. 　Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 65 percent. 　In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances. 　Detroit's diverse culture has had both local and international influence, particularly in music, with the city giving rise to the genres of Motown and techno, and playing an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk. 　The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places. 　Since the 2000s, conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieved several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. 　More recently, the population of Downtown Detroit, Midtown Detroit, and various other neighborhoods have increased.　[citation needed] An increasingly popular tourist destination, Detroit receives 16 million visitors per year. 　In 2015, Detroit was named a "City of Design" by UNESCO, the first U.S. city to receive that designation.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat>Meat</a> </h2>
<p>Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. 　Humans have hunted, farmed, and scavenged animals for meat since prehistoric times. 　The establishment of settlements in the Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs, and cattle. 　This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale in slaughterhouses. 　Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. 　It is edible raw but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. 　Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with, and decomposition by, bacteria and fungi. 　Meat is important to the food industry, economies, and cultures around the world. 　There are nonetheless people who choose to not eat meat (vegetarians) or any animal products (vegans), for reasons such as taste preferences, ethics, environmental concerns, health concerns or religious dietary rules.</p>

<p>Nanna, Sīn /ˈsiːn/ or Suen (Akkadian: 𒂗𒍪 EN.ZU, pronounced Su'en, Sen, Sîn), and in Aramaic syn, syn’, or even shr 'moon', or Nannar (Sumerian: 𒀭𒋀𒆠 DŠEŠ.KI, DNANNAR) was the god of the moon in the Mesopotamian religions of Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia and Aram. 　He was also associated with cattle, perhaps due to the perceived similarity between bull horns and the crescent moon. 　He was always described as a major deity, though only a few sources, mostly these from the reign of Nabonidus, consider him to be the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon. 　The two chief seats of his worship were Ur in the south of Mesopotamia and Harran in the north, though he was also worshiped in numerous other cities, especially in the proximity of Ur and in the Diyala area. 　In Ur, he was connected to royal power, and many Mesopotamian kings visited his temple in this city. 　According to Mesopotamian mythology, his parents were Enlil and Ninlil, while his wife was Ningal, worshiped with him in his major cult centers. 　Their children included major deities Innanna (Ishtar) and Utu (Shamash) and minor gods such as Ningublaga and Numushda. 　Some deities, for example Nanaya and Pinikir, were sometimes regarded as his children due to syncretism between them and his daughter Ishtar. 　Nanna acquired a number of syncretic associations himself, and the logographic writings of his name were used to represent these of other moon gods, such as Ugaritic Yarikh or Hurrian Kusuh.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral>Integral</a> </h2>
<p>In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. 　Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operation of calculus, the other being differentiation. 　Integration started as a method to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity. 　Today integration is used in a wide variety of scientific fields. 　The integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. 　Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. 　Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. 　In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. 　The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known. 　Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. 　Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into infinitesimally thin vertical slabs. 　In the early 20th century, Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann's formulation by introducing what is now referred to as the Lebesgue integral; it is more robust than Riemann's in the sense that a wider class of functions are Lebesgue-integrable. 　Integrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. 　For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. 　In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon>Demon</a> </h2>
<p>A demon is a malevolent supernatural entity. 　Historically, belief in demons, or stories about demons, occurs in religion, occultism, literature, fiction, mythology, and folklore; as well as in media such as comics, video games, movies, anime, and television series. 　Belief in demons probably goes back to the Paleolithic age, stemming from humanity's fear of the unknown, the strange and the horrific. 　In ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic religions, including early Judaism and ancient-medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity which may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism. 　Large portions of Jewish demonology, a key influence on Christianity and Islam, originated from a later form of Zoroastrianism, and was transferred to Judaism during the Persian era. 　Demons may or may not also be considered to be devils: minions of the Devil. 　In many traditions, demons are independent operators, with different demons causing different types of evils (destructive natural phenomena, specific diseases, etc.). 　In religions featuring a principal Devil (e.g. Satan) locked in an eternal struggle with God, demons are often also thought to be subordinates of the principal Devil. 　As lesser spirits doing the Devil's work, they have additional duties— causing humans to have sinful thoughts and tempting humans to commit sinful actions. 　The original Ancient Greek word daimōn (δαίμων) did not carry negative connotations, as it denotes a spirit or divine power. 　The Greek conception of a daimōn notably appears in the philosophical works of Plato, where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates. 　In Christianity, morally ambivalent daimōn were replaced by demons, forces of evil only striving for corruption. 　Such demons are not the Greek intermediary spirits, but hostile entities, already known in Iranian beliefs. 　In Western occultism and Renaissance magic, which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic, Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology, a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled. 　Belief in demons remains an important part of many modern religions and occultist traditions. 　Demons are still feared largely due to their alleged power to possess living creatures. 　In the contemporary Western occultist tradition (perhaps epitomized by the work of Aleister Crowley), a demon (such as Choronzon, which is Crowley's interpretation of the so-called "Demon of the Abyss") is a useful metaphor for certain inner psychological processes (inner demons), though some may also regard it as an objectively real phenomenon.</p>
