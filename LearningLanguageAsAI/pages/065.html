<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing>Pointing</a> </h2>
<p>Pointing is a gesture specifying a direction from a person's body, usually indicating a location, person, event, thing or idea. 　It typically is formed by extending the arm, hand, and index finger, although it may be functionally similar to other hand gestures. 　Types of pointing may be subdivided according to the intention of the person, as well as by the linguistic function it serves. 　Pointing typically develops within the first two years of life in humans, and plays an important role in language development and reading in children. 　It is central to the use of sign language, with a large number of signs being some variation on pointing. 　The nature of pointing may differ for children who have autism or who are deaf, and may also vary by gender. 　It is typically not observed in children who are blind from birth. 　Pointing may vary substantially across cultures, with some having many distinct types of pointing, both with regard to the physical gestures employed and their interpretation. 　Pointing, especially at other people, may be considered inappropriate or rude in certain contexts and in many cultures. 　It is generally regarded as a species-specific human feature that does not normally occur in other primates in the wild. 　It has been observed in animals in captivity; however, there is disagreement on the nature of this non-human pointing.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor>Tensor</a> </h2>
<p>Look up tensor in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space. 　Tensors may map between different objects such as vectors, scalars, and even other tensors. 　There are many types of tensors, including scalars and vectors (which are the simplest tensors), dual vectors, multilinear maps between vector spaces, and even some operations such as the dot product. 　Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are often referred to by their components in a basis related to a particular coordinate system. 　Tensors have become important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as mechanics (stress, elasticity, fluid mechanics, moment of inertia, ...), electrodynamics (electromagnetic tensor, Maxwell tensor, permittivity, magnetic susceptibility, ...), general relativity (stress–energy tensor, curvature tensor, ...) and others. 　In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. 　This leads to the concept of a tensor field. 　In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are often simply called "tensors". 　Tullio Levi-Civita and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro popularised tensors in 1900 – continuing the earlier work of Bernhard Riemann and Elwin Bruno Christoffel and others – as part of the absolute differential calculus. 　The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic differential geometry of a manifold in the form of the Riemann curvature tensor.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi>Delhi</a> </h2>
<p>Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. 　Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. 　The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). 　According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million. 　Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). 　The topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. 　From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. 　All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. 　Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. 　The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. 　The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of the Urdu language and then of Modern Standard Hindi. 　Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib. 　Delhi was a major centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. 　In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire. 　During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu refugees from western Punjab. 　After independence in 1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of India. 　Delhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index. 　Delhi has the second-highest GDP per capita in India (after Goa). 　Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. 　New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. 　Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an "interstate regional planning" area created in 1985. 　Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(sociology)>Consumption (sociology)</a> </h2>
<p>Theories of consumption have been a part of the field of sociology since its earliest days, dating back, at least implicitly, to the work of Karl Marx in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. 　Sociologists view consumption as central to everyday life, identity and social order. 　Many sociologists associate it with social class, identity, group membership, age and stratification as it plays a huge part in modernity. 　Thorstein Veblen's (1899) The Theory of the Leisure Class is generally seen as the first major theoretical work to take consumption as its primary focus. 　Despite these early roots, research on consumption began in earnest in the second half of the twentieth century in Europe, especially Great Britain. 　Interest in the topic among mainstream US sociologists was much slower to develop and it is still not[when?] a focal concern of many American sociologists. 　Efforts are currently[when?] underway to form a section in the American Sociological Association devoted to the study of consumption. 　However, over the last[when?] twenty years, sociological research into the area of consumption has burgeoned in cognate fields, particularly in global and cultural studies: The processes associated with globalization have created hitherto unimaginable opportunities for cultural forms and practices to travel far beyond the indigenous sites and spaces in which they were first conceived and produced. 　While there have always been cultural movements and flows from one space to another, the intensity and ease of contemporary intersections of the global and the local have forced scholars to look closely at the myriad ways in which culture is consumed – used up, made sense of, embraced, and explored. 　Modern theorists of consumption include Jean Baudrillard, Pierre Bourdieu, and George Ritzer.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion>Lion</a> </h2>
<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 　It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 　It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 　It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 　A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. 　Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 　The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans. 　The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. 　It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 　During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. 　It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. 　Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. 　Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. 　One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. 　Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. 　Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)>Mood (psychology)</a> </h2>
<p>In psychology, a mood is an affective state. 　In contrast to emotions or feelings, moods are less specific, less intense and less likely to be provoked or instantiated by a particular stimulus or event. 　Moods are typically described as having either a positive or negative valence. 　In other words, people usually talk about being in a good mood or a bad mood. 　There are many different factors that influence mood, and these can lead to positive or negative effects on mood. 　Mood also differs from temperament or personality traits which are even longer-lasting. 　Nevertheless, personality traits such as optimism and neuroticism predispose certain types of moods. 　Long term disturbances of mood such as clinical depression and bipolar disorder are considered mood disorders. 　Mood is an internal, subjective state but it often can be inferred from posture and other behaviors. 　"We can be sent into a mood by an unexpected event, from the happiness of seeing an old friend to the anger of discovering betrayal by a partner. We may also just fall into a mood."</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute>Tribute</a> </h2>
<p>A tribute (/ˈtrɪbjuːt/; from Latin tributum, "contribution") is wealth, often in kind, that a party gives to another as a sign of submission, allegiance or respect. 　Various ancient states exacted tribute from the rulers of land which the state conquered or otherwise threatened to conquer. 　In case of alliances, lesser parties may pay tribute to more powerful parties as a sign of allegiance and often in order to finance projects that would benefit both parties. 　To be called "tribute" a recognition by the payer of political submission to the payee is normally required; the large sums, essentially protection money, paid by the later Roman and Byzantine Empires to barbarian peoples to prevent them attacking imperial territory, would not usually be termed "tribute" as the Empire accepted no inferior political position. 　Payments by a superior political entity to an inferior one, made for various purposes, are described by terms including "subsidy". 　The ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire is an example of an ancient tribute empire; one that made relatively few demands on its non-Persian subjects other than the regular payment of tribute, which might be gold, luxury goods, animals, soldiers or slaves. 　However, failure to keep up the payments had dire consequences. 　The reliefs at Persepolis show processions of figures bearing varied types of tribute. 　The medieval Mongol rulers of Russia also expected only tribute from the Russian states, which continued to govern themselves. 　Athens received tribute from the other cities of the Delian League. 　The empires of Assyria, Babylon, Carthage and Rome exacted tribute from their provinces and subject kingdoms. 　Ancient China received tribute from various states such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar and Central Asia (listed here). 　The Roman republic exacted tribute in the form of payments equivalent to proportional property taxes, for the purpose of waging war. 　Tribute empires contrast with those like the Roman Empire, which more closely controlled and garrisoned subject territories. 　A tributary state is one that preserves its political position and such independence as it has only by paying tribute. 　Although, Roman Republic and Roman Empire sometimes controlled client kingdoms providing it with tribute.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan>Manhattan</a> </h2>
<p>Manhattan (/mænˈhætən, mən-/) is the most densely populated and geographically smallest of the five boroughs of New York City. 　The borough is also coextensive with New York County, one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. 　Located near the southern tip of the State of New York, Manhattan is based in the Eastern Time Zone and constitutes both the geographical and demographic center of the Northeast megalopolis and the urban core of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. 　Over 58 million people live within 250 miles of Manhattan, which serves as New York City’s economic and administrative center, cultural identifier, and the city’s historical birthplace. 　Residents of the outer boroughs of New York City often refer to Manhattan as "the city". 　Manhattan has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world, is considered a safe haven for global real estate investors, and hosts the United Nations headquarters. 　Manhattan also serves as the headquarters of the global art market, with numerous art galleries and auction houses collectively hosting half of the world’s art auctions. 　Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, the borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers along with several small adjacent islands, including Roosevelt, U Thant, and Randalls and Wards Islands. 　Manhattan additionally contains the small neighborhood of Marble Hill on the U.S. mainland, which is separated from Manhattan Island by the Harlem Ship Canal and was later connected using landfill to the Bronx. 　Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components, each cutting across the borough's long axis: Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. 　Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and Manhattan is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. 　Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan, and the borough has been the setting for numerous books, films, and television shows. 　Manhattan real estate is among the most expensive in the world, with the value of Manhattan Island, including real estate, estimated to exceed US$3 trillion in 2013; median residential property sale prices in Manhattan approximated US$1,600 per square foot ($17,000/m2) as of 2018, with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commanding the highest retail rents in the world, at US$3,000 per square foot ($32,000/m2) per year in 2017. 　In 2022, the average monthly apartment rent in Manhattan climbed over US$5,000.00 for the first time. 　The area of Manhattan was originally part of Lenape territory. 　European settlement began with the establishment of a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. 　The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. 　New York, based in present-day Manhattan, served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. 　The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th century and is a world symbol of the United States and its ideals of liberty and peace. 　Manhattan became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898. 　New York County is the smallest county by land area in the contiguous United States, as well as the most densely populated U.S. county. 　Manhattan is one of the most densely populated locations in the world, with a 2020 census population of 1,694,251 living in a land area of 22.83 square miles (59.13 km2), or 72,918 residents per square mile (28,154/km2), higher than the density of any individual U.S. city. 　On business days, the influx of commuters increases this number to over 3.9 million, or more than 170,000 people per square mile (65,600/km2). 　Manhattan has the third-largest population of New York City's five boroughs, after Brooklyn and Queens, and is the smallest borough in terms of land area. 　If each borough were ranked as a city, Manhattan would rank as the sixth-most populous in the U.S. Many districts and landmarks in Manhattan are well known, as New York City received a record 62.8 million tourists in 2017, and Manhattan hosts three of the world's 10 most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal. 　The Empire State Building has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. 　Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere. 　The borough hosts many prominent bridges, including the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, Queensboro, Triborough, and George Washington Bridges; tunnels such as the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels; skyscrapers including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and One World Trade Center; and parks, such as Central Park. 　Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, and Koreatown is replete with karaoke bars. 　The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, part of the Stonewall National Monument, is considered the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. 　The City of New York was founded at the southern tip of Manhattan, and the borough houses New York City Hall, the seat of the city's government. 　Numerous colleges and universities are located in Manhattan, including Columbia University, New York University, Cornell Tech, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 40 in the world. 　The Metropolitan Museum of Art is both the largest art museum and the most visited museum in the United States. 　Governors Island in New York Harbor is planned to host a US$1 billion research and education center poised to make New York City the global leader in addressing the climate crisis.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)>Phoenix (mythology)</a> </h2>
<p>The phoenix is an immortal bird associated with Greek mythology (with analogs in many cultures) that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. 　Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor. 　Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again. 　In the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, a tool used by folklorists, the phoenix is classified as motif B32. 　The origin of the phoenix has been attributed to Ancient Egypt by Herodotus and later 19th-century scholars, but other scholars think the Egyptian texts may have been influenced by classical folklore. 　Over time the phoenix motif spread and gained a variety of new associations; Herodotus, Lucan, Pliny the Elder, Pope Clement I, Lactantius, Ovid, and Isidore of Seville are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. 　Over time, extending beyond its origins, the phoenix could variously "symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, the Empire, metempsychosis, consecration, resurrection, life in the heavenly Paradise, Christ, Mary, virginity, the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life". 　Some scholars have claimed that the poem De ave phoenice may present the mythological phoenix motif as a symbol of Christ's resurrection.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)>Attitude (psychology)</a> </h2>
<p>In psychology, attitude is a psychological construct that is a mental and emotional entity that inheres or characterizes a person, their attitude to approach to something, or their personal view on it. 　Attitude involves their mindset, outlook and feelings. 　Attitudes are complex and are an acquired state through life experience. 　Attitude is an individual's predisposed state of mind regarding a value and it is precipitated through a responsive expression towards oneself, a person, place, thing, or event (the attitude object) which in turn influences the individual's thought and action. 　Most simply understood attitudes in psychology are the feelings individuals have about themselves and the world. 　Prominent psychologist Gordon Allport described this latent psychological construct as "the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary social psychology." 　Attitudes can be formed from a person's past and present. 　Key topics in the study of attitudes include attitude strength, attitude change, consumer behavior, and attitude-behavior relationships.</p>

<p>A telescope is a device used to observe distant objects by their emission, absorption, or reflection of electromagnetic radiation. 　Originally meaning only an optical instrument using lenses, curved mirrors, or a combination of both to observe distant objects, the word telescope now refers to a wide range of instruments capable of detecting different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in some cases other types of detectors. 　The first known practical telescopes were refracting telescopes with glass lenses and were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century. 　They were used for both terrestrial applications and astronomy. 　The reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors to collect and focus light, was invented within a few decades of the first refracting telescope. 　In the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile>Chile</a> </h2>
<p>Coordinates: 34°S 71°W﻿ / ﻿34°S 71°W﻿ / -34; -71 Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a country located in western South America. 　It is the southernmost country in the world and closest to Antarctica, stretching along a narrow strip of land between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. 　With an area of 756,096 square kilometers (291,930 sq mi) and a population of 17.5 million as of 2017, Chile shares borders with Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. 　The country also controls several Pacific islands, including Juan Fernández, Isla Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island, and claims about 1,250,000 square kilometers (480,000 sq mi) of Antarctica as the Chilean Antarctic Territory. 　The capital and largest city of Chile is Santiago, and the national language is Spanish. 　Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century, replacing Inca rule, but failed to conquer the independent Mapuche people who inhabited what is now south-central Chile. 　In 1818, after declaring independence from Spain, Chile emerged as a relatively stable authoritarian republic in the 1830s. 　During the 19th century, Chile experienced significant economic and territorial growth, putting an end to Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific (1879–83) by defeating Peru and Bolivia. 　In the 20th century, up until the 1970s, Chile underwent a process of democratization and experienced rapid population growth and urbanization, while relying increasingly on exports from copper mining to support its economy. 　During the 1960s and 1970s, the country was marked by severe left-right political polarization and turmoil, which culminated in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende's democratically elected left-wing government. 　This was followed by a 16-year right-wing military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet, which resulted in more than 3,000 deaths or disappearances. 　The regime ended in 1990, following a referendum in 1988, and was succeeded by a center-left coalition, which ruled until 2010. 　Chile is a developing country with a high-income economy and ranks 42nd in the Human Development Index. 　It is one of the most economically and socially stable nations in South America, and leads Latin America in competitiveness, per capita income, globalization, peace, and economic freedom. 　Chile also performs well in the region in terms of sustainability of the state and democratic development, and boasts the lowest homicide rate in the Americas, following only Canada. 　Chile is a founding member of the United Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Pacific Alliance, and joined the OECD in 2010.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen>Hydrogen</a> </h2>
<p>Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. 　Hydrogen is the lightest element. 　At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. 　It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. 　Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. 　Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. 　Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. 　For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons. 　In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang. 　The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. 　Hydrogen is nonmetallic (except it becomes metallic at extremely high pressures) and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly all organic compounds. 　Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. 　In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. 　The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. 　Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics. 　Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. 　In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means "water-former". 　Industrial production is mainly from steam reforming of natural gas, oil reforming, or coal gasification. 　A small percentage is also produced using more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water. 　Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. 　It can be burned to produce heat or combined with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity directly, with water being the only emissions at the point of usage. 　Hydrogen atoms (but not gaseous molecules) are problematic in metallurgy because they can embrittle many metals.</p>

<p>A villa is a type of house that was originally an ancient Roman upper class country house. 　Since its origins in the Roman villa, the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably. 　After the fall of the Roman Republic, villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in Late Antiquity, sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a monastery. 　Then they gradually re-evolved through the Middle Ages into elegant upper-class country homes. 　In the Early Modern period, any comfortable detached house with a garden near a city or town was likely to be described as a villa; most survivals have now been engulfed by suburbia. 　In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences, ranging from the suburban semi-detached double villa to, in some countries, especially around the Mediterranean, residences of above average size in the countryside.</p>
