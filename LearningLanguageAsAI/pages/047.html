<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat>Hat</a> </h2>
<p>A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory. 　Hats which incorporate mechanical features, such as visors, spikes, flaps, braces or beer holders shade into the broader category of headgear. 　In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. 　In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. 　Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 　Some hats have a protective function. 　As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects, a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. 　Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. 　Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs, or the mitre worn by Christian bishops. 　Adherents of certain religions regularly wear hats, such as the turban worn by Sikhs, or the church hat that is worn as a headcovering by Christian women during prayer and worship.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon>Dragon</a> </h2>
<p>A dragon is a reptilian legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide. 　Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. 　Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. 　Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, reptilian, and avian features. 　Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero>Hero</a> </h2>
<p>A hero (feminine: heroine) is a real person or a main fictional character who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, courage, or strength. 　Like other formerly gender-specific terms (like actor), hero is often used to refer to any gender, though heroine only refers to women. 　The original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. 　Post-classical and modern heroes, on the other hand, perform great deeds or selfless acts for the common good instead of the classical goal of wealth, pride, and fame. 　The antonym of hero is villain. 　Other terms associated with the concept of hero may include good guy or white hat. 　In classical literature, the hero is the main or revered character in heroic epic poetry celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code. 　The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. 　Merriam Webster dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities". 　Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as Gilgamesh, Achilles and Iphigenia, to historical and modern figures, such as Joan of Arc, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Sophie Scholl, Alvin York, Audie Murphy, and Chuck Yeager, and fictional "superheroes", including Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, and Captain America.</p>

<p>Economics (/ˌɛkəˈnɒmɪks, ˌiːkə-/) is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. 　Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. 　Microeconomics analyzes what's viewed as basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. 　Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. 　Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements. 　Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing "what is", and normative economics, advocating "what ought to be"; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics. 　Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. 　It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing>Fishing</a> </h2>
<p>Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. 　Fish are often caught as wildlife from the natural environment, but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water such as ponds, canals, park wetlands and reservoirs. 　Fishing techniques include hand-gathering, spearing, netting, angling, shooting and trapping, as well as more destructive and often illegal techniques such as electrocution, blasting and poisoning. 　The term fishing broadly includes catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as crustaceans (shrimp/lobsters/crabs), shellfish, cephalopods (octopus/squid) and echinoderms (starfish/sea urchins). 　The term is not normally applied to harvesting fish raised in controlled cultivations (fish farming). 　Nor is it normally applied to hunting aquatic mammals, where terms like whaling and sealing are used instead. 　Fishing has been an important part of human culture since hunter-gatherer times, and is one of the few food production activities that have persisted from prehistory into modern age, surviving both the Neolithic Revolution and successive Industrial Revolutions. 　In addition to being caught to be eaten for food, fish are caught as recreational pastimes. 　Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept long-term as preserved or living trophies. 　When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released. 　According to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishers and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. 　Fishing industries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries. 　In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms (32 lb), with an additional 7.4 kilograms (16 lb) harvested from fish farms.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste>Taste</a> </h2>
<p>The gustatory system or sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor). 　Taste is the perception produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. 　Taste, along with olfaction and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances. 　Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas, including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. 　The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste. 　The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. 　Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. 　The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. 　There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. 　Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. 　Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells. 　Taste receptors in the mouth sense the five taste modalities: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and savoriness (also known as savory or umami). 　Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.　[citation needed] Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. 　Sweet, savoriness, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. 　Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively. 　The basic taste modalities contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture, detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc.　; temperature, detected by thermoreceptors; and "coolness" (such as of menthol) and "hotness" (pungency), through chemesthesis. 　As the gustatory system senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic taste modalities are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on the body. 　Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons. 　Among humans, taste perception begins to fade at an older age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production. 　Humans can also have distortion of tastes (dysgeusia). 　Not all mammals share the same taste modalities: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste modalities.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury>Jury</a> </h2>
<p>A jury is a sworn body of people (jurors) convened to hear evidence and render an impartial verdict (a finding of fact on a question) officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. 　Juries developed in England during the Middle Ages and are a hallmark of the English common law system. 　As such, they are used by the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and other countries whose legal systems were derived from the British Empire. 　But most other countries use variations of the European civil law or Islamic sharia law systems, in which juries are not generally used. 　Most trial juries are "petit juries", and usually consist of twelve people. 　Historically, a larger jury known as a grand jury was used to investigate potential crimes and render indictments against suspects. 　All common law countries except the United States and Liberia have phased these out. 　The modern criminal court jury arrangement has evolved out of the medieval juries in England. 　Members were supposed to inform themselves of crimes and then of the details of the crimes. 　Their function was therefore closer to that of a grand jury than that of a jury in a trial.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay>Gay</a> </h2>
<p>Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual. 　The term originally meant 'carefree', 'cheerful', or 'bright and showy'. 　While scant usage referring to male homosexuality dates to the late 19th century, that meaning became increasingly common by the mid-20th century. 　In modern English, gay has come to be used as an adjective, and as a noun, referring to the community, practices and cultures associated with homosexuality. 　In the 1960s, gay became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their sexual orientation. 　By the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, the word gay was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex, although it is more commonly used to refer specifically to men. 　At about the same time, a new, pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world. 　Among younger speakers, the word has a meaning ranging from derision (e.g., equivalent to 'rubbish' or 'stupid') to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule (e.g., equivalent to 'weak', 'unmanly', or 'lame'). 　The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.　[needs update]</p>

<p>A ghost is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that is believed to be able to appear to the living. 　In ghostlore, descriptions of ghosts vary widely, from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes to realistic, lifelike forms. 　The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a séance. 　Other terms associated with it are apparition, haunt, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter, spirit, spook, wraith, demon, and ghoul. 　The belief in the existence of an afterlife, as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. 　Certain religious practices—funeral rites, exorcisms, and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magic—are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. 　Ghosts are generally described as solitary, human-like essences, though stories of ghostly armies and the ghosts of animals other than humans have also been recounted. 　They are believed to haunt particular locations, objects, or people they were associated with in life. 　According to a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center, 18% of Americans say they have seen a ghost. 　The overwhelming consensus of science is that there is no proof that ghosts exist. 　Their existence is impossible to falsify, and ghost hunting has been classified as pseudoscience. 　Despite centuries of investigation, there is no scientific evidence that any location is inhabited by the spirits of the dead. 　Historically, certain toxic and psychoactive plants (such as datura and hyoscyamus niger), whose use has long been associated with necromancy and the underworld, have been shown to contain anticholinergic compounds that are pharmacologically linked to dementia (specifically DLB) as well as histological patterns of neurodegeneration. 　Recent research has indicated that ghost sightings may be related to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. 　Common prescription medication and over-the-counter drugs (such as sleep aids) may also, in rare instances, cause ghost-like hallucinations, particularly zolpidem and diphenhydramine. 　Older reports linked carbon monoxide poisoning to ghost-like hallucinations. 　In folklore studies, ghosts fall within the motif index designation E200–E599 ("Ghosts and other revenants").</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger>Roger</a> </h2>
<p>Roger is a masculine given name, and a surname. 　The given name is derived from the Old French personal names Roger and Rogier. 　These names are of Germanic origin, derived from the elements hrōd, χrōþi ("fame", "renown", "honour") and gār, gēr ("spear", "lance") (Hrōþigēraz). 　The name was introduced into England by the Normans. 　In Normandy, the Frankish name had been reinforced by the Old Norse cognate Hróðgeirr. 　The name introduced into England replaced the Old English cognate Hroðgar. 　Roger became a very common given name during the Middle Ages. 　A variant form of the given name Roger that is closer to the name's origin is Rodger.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid>Acid</a> </h2>
<p>An acid is a molecule or ion capable of either donating a proton (i.e. hydrogen ion, H+), known as a Brønsted–Lowry acid, or forming a covalent bond with an electron pair, known as a Lewis acid. 　The first category of acids are the proton donors, or Brønsted–Lowry acids. 　In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids. 　Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. 　A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+. 　Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties that provide a practical description of an acid. 　Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. 　The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus, meaning 'sour'. 　An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as "acid" (as in "dissolved in acid"), while the strict definition refers only to the solute. 　A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. 　Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic. 　Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride that is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits). 　As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. 　Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid. 　The second category of acids are Lewis acids, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. 　An example is boron trifluoride (BF3), whose boron atom has a vacant orbital that can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3). 　Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons (H+) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. 　Hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted–Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair, however, and are therefore not Lewis acids. 　Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted–Lowry acids. 　In modern terminology, an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest>Protest</a> </h2>
<p>A protest (also called a demonstration, remonstration or remonstrance or a maree richo) is a public expression of objection, disapproval or dissent towards an idea or action, typically a political one. 　Protests can be thought of as acts of cooperation in which numerous people cooperate by attending, and share the potential costs and risks of doing so. 　Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. 　Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to enact desired changes themselves. 　Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful nonviolent campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as a type of protest called civil resistance or nonviolent resistance. 　Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted by governmental policy (such as the requirement of protest permits), economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or media monopoly. 　One state reaction to protests is the use of riot police. 　Observers have noted an increased militarization of protest policing in many countries, with police deploying armored vehicles and snipers against protesters. 　When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open civil disobedience, more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as culture and emigration. 　A protest itself may at times be the subject of a counter-protest. 　In such cases, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, policy, action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest. 　Protesters and counter-protesters can sometimes violently clash. 　One study found that non-violent activism during the civil rights movement in the United States tended to produce favorable media coverage and changes in public opinion focusing on the issues organizers were raising, but violent protests tended to generate unfavorable media coverage that generated public desire to restore law and order.</p>

<p>A knife (PL: knives; from Old Norse knifr 'knife, dirk') is a tool or weapon with a cutting edge or blade, usually attached to a handle or hilt. 　One of the earliest tools used by humanity, knives appeared at least 2.5 million years ago, as evidenced by the Oldowan tools. 　Originally made of wood, bone, and stone (such as flint and obsidian), over the centuries, in step with improvements in both metallurgy and manufacturing, knife blades have been made from copper, bronze, iron, steel, ceramic, and titanium. 　Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin. 　Knives can serve various purposes. 　Hunters use a hunting knife, soldiers use the combat knife, scouts, campers, and hikers carry a pocket knife; there are kitchen knives for preparing foods (the chef's knife, the paring knife, bread knife, cleaver), table knives (butter knives and steak knives), weapons (daggers or switchblades), knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display (the kirpan).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity>Complexity</a> </h2>
<p>Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, leading to nonlinearity, randomness, collective dynamics, hierarchy, and emergence. 　The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of emergence greater than the sum of its parts. 　The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of complex systems theory. 　The intuitive criterion of complexity can be formulated as follows: a system would be more complex if more parts could be distinguished, and if more connections between them existed. 　Science as of 2010[update] takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed et al. reflect many of these. 　Neil Johnson states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..." 　Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".</p>

<p>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar. 　Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of Camellia taliensis. 　After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. 　There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. 　Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content. 　An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese physician Hua Tuo. 　It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread to other East Asian countries. 　Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. 　During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in British India. 　The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis. 　They are the infusions of fruit, leaves, or other plant parts, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. 　These may be called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database>Database</a> </h2>
<p>In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. 　Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. 　The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance. 　A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. 　The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. 　The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. 　Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. 　Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. 　Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. 　These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. 　In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.</p>
