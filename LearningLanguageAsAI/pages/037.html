<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution>Institution</a> </h2>
<p>Institutions (singular: institutions) are humanly devised structures of rules and norms that shape and constrain individual behavior. 　All definitions of institutions generally entail that there is a level of persistence and continuity. 　Laws, rules, social conventions and norms are all examples of institutions. 　Institutions vary in their level of formality and informality. 　Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology (the latter described by Émile Durkheim as the "science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning"). 　Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family or money that are broad enough to encompass sets of related institutions. 　Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement. 　Historians study and document the founding, growth, decay and development of institutions as part of political, economic and cultural history.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery>Artillery</a> </h2>
<p>Artillery is a class of heavy military ranged weapons that launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms. 　Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during sieges, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. 　As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery cannons developed for battlefield use. 　This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility generally providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.　[citation needed] Originally, the word "artillery" referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armor. 　Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, "artillery" has largely meant cannons, and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, and mortars (collectively called barrel artillery, cannon artillery, gun artillery, or—a layman term—tube artillery), and rocket artillery. 　In common speech, the word "artillery" is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called "equipment". 　However, there is no generally recognized generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses "artillery piece", but most English-speaking armies use "gun" and "mortar". 　The projectiles fired are typically either "shot" (if solid) or "shell" (if not solid). 　Historically, variants of solid shot including canister, chain shot and grapeshot were also used. 　"Shell" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions. 　By association, artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines. 　In some armies, the artillery arm has operated field, coastal, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank artillery; in others these have been separate arms, and with some nations coastal has been a naval or marine responsibility. 　In the 20th century, technology-based target acquisition devices (such as radar) and systems (such as sound ranging and flash spotting) emerged in order to acquire targets, primarily for artillery. 　These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms. 　The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, and in some armies, provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm. 　Artillery has been used since at least the early Industrial Revolution. 　The majority of combat deaths in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II were caused by artillery. 　In 1944, Joseph Stalin said in a speech that artillery was "the god of war".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chose>Chose</a> </h2>
<p>Chose (pronounced: /ʃoʊz/, French for "thing") is a term used in common law tradition to refer to rights in property, specifically a combined bundle of rights. 　A chose describes the enforcement right which a party possesses in an object. 　The use of chose extends from the English use of French within the courts. 　In English and commonwealth law, all personal things fall into one of two categories, either choses in action or choses in possession. 　English law uses a chose to refer to a bundle of rights, traditionally relating to property which may be utilised in certain circumstances. 　Thus, a chose in action refers to a bundle of personal rights which can only be enforced or claimed by a chose-holder bringing an action through the court to enforce the action. 　In English law, this category is enormously wide. 　This is contrasted with a chose in possession which represents rights which can be enforced or acquired by taking physical possession of the chose. 　This may be, for example a legal mortgage. 　Both choses in possession and choses in action create separate proprietary interests. 　What differs between each is the method in which each chose may be enforced. 　This is dependent on the possessory nature of the reference object. 　Alternative, historical uses includes a chose local, a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill; a chose transitory, something movable that can be carried from place to place.　[citation needed]</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera>Camera</a> </h2>
<p>A camera is an optical instrument that captures images. 　Most cameras can capture 2D images, while some more advanced models can capture 3D images. 　At a basic level, most cameras consist of a sealed box (the camera body), with a small hole (the aperture) that allows light to pass through and capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually a digital sensor or photographic film). 　Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the light-sensitive surface, including lenses that focus the light and a shutter that determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to the light. 　The still image camera is a key instrument in the art of photography. 　Captured images may be reproduced later through processes such as digital imaging or photographic printing. 　Similar artistic fields in the moving-image camera domain include film, videography, and cinematography. 　The word camera comes from camera obscura, which is Latin for "dark chamber" and refers to the original device used to project a 2D image onto a flat surface. 　The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. 　The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce.</p>

<p>Credit (from Latin verb credit, meaning "one believes") is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date. 　The resources provided by the first party can be either property, fulfillment of promises, or performances. 　In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people. 　The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit). 　Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment. 　Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods>Goods</a> </h2>
<p>In economics, goods are items that satisfy human wants and provide utility, for example, to a consumer making a purchase of a satisfying product. 　A common distinction is made between goods which are transferable, and services, which are not transferable. 　A good is an "economic good" if it is useful to people but scarce in relation to its demand so that human effort is required to obtain it. 　In contrast, free goods, such as air, are naturally in abundant supply and need no conscious effort to obtain them. 　Private goods are things owned by people, such as televisions, living room furniture, wallets, cellular telephones, almost anything owned or used on a daily basis that is not food-related. 　A consumer good or "final good" is any item that is ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. 　For example, a microwave oven or a bicycle that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are intermediate goods. 　For example, textiles or transistors can be used to make some further goods. 　Commercial goods are construed as tangible products that are manufactured and then made available for supply to be used in an industry of commerce. 　Commercial goods could be tractors, commercial vehicles, mobile structures, airplanes, and even roofing materials. 　Commercial and personal goods as categories are very broad and cover almost everything a person sees from the time they wake up in their home, on their commute to work to their arrival at the workplace. 　Commodities may be used as a synonym for economic goods but often refer to marketable raw materials and primary products. 　Although common goods are tangible, certain classes of goods, such as information, only take intangible forms. 　For example, among other goods an apple is a tangible object, while news belongs to an intangible class of goods and can be perceived only by means of an instrument such as printers or television.</p>

<p>In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of miniature liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space. 　Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. 　On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature. 　Clouds are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. 　Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. 　There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common name. 　Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802. 　It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera. 　The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and cirriform. 　Low-level clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes. 　However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-. 　In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing. 　Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes. 　They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical. 　Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties. 　Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names. 　In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types. 　They may have the appearance of stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. 　They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. 　Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond. 　However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water. 　Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth. 　They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect. 　The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere. 　Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change. 　Clouds are the main uncertainty in climate sensitivity.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability>Probability</a> </h2>
<p>Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. 　The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. 　The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. 　A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. 　Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes ("heads" and "tails") are both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals the probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%). 　These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. 　Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure>Pleasure</a> </h2>
<p>Pleasure refers to experience that feels good, that involves the enjoyment of something. 　It contrasts with pain or suffering, which are forms of feeling bad. 　It is closely related to value, desire and action: humans and other conscious animals find pleasure enjoyable, positive or worthy of seeking. 　A great variety of activities may be experienced as pleasurable, like eating, having sex, listening to music or playing games. 　Pleasure is part of various other mental states such as ecstasy, euphoria and flow. 　Happiness and well-being are closely related to pleasure but not identical with it. 　There is no general agreement as to whether pleasure should be understood as a sensation, a quality of experiences, an attitude to experiences or otherwise. 　Pleasure plays a central role in the family of philosophical theories known as hedonism.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income>Income</a> </h2>
<p>Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms. 　Income is difficult to define conceptually and the definition may be different across fields.　[page needed] For example, a person's income in an economic sense may be different from their income as defined by law. 　An extremely important definition of income is Haig–Simons income, which defines income as Consumption + Change in net worth and is widely used in economics. 　For households and individuals in the United States, income is defined by tax law as a sum that includes any wage, salary, profit, interest payment, rent, or other form of earnings received in a calendar year. 　Discretionary income is often defined as gross income minus taxes and other deductions (e.g., mandatory pension contributions), and is widely used as a basis to compare the welfare of taxpayers. 　In the field of public economics, the concept may comprise the accumulation of both monetary and non-monetary consumption ability, with the former (monetary) being used as a proxy for total income. 　For a firm, gross income can be defined as sum of all revenue minus the cost of goods sold. 　Net income nets out expenses: net income equals revenue minus cost of goods sold, expenses, depreciation, interest, and taxes.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel>Fuel</a> </h2>
<p>A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as thermal energy or to be used for work. 　The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy, such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). 　The heat energy released by reactions of fuels can be converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine. 　Other times, the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that accompanies combustion. 　Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. 　Hydrocarbons and related organic molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized. 　Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing>Singing</a> </h2>
<p>Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. 　A person who sings is called a singer, artist or vocalist (in jazz and/or popular music). 　Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. 　Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. 　Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. 　Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music, Japanese music, and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal, and popular music styles such as pop, rock, and electronic dance music. 　Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. 　It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. 　Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. 　If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. 　Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). 　Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers</p>

<p>A flag is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or quadrilateral) with a distinctive design and colours. 　It is used as a symbol, a signalling device, or for decoration. 　The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging (such as the maritime environment, where semaphore is used). 　Many flags fall into groups of similar designs called flag families. 　The study of flags is known as "vexillology" from the Latin vexillumcode: lat promoted to code: la , meaning "flag" or "banner". 　National flags are patriotic symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong military associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose. 　Flags are also used in messaging, advertising, or for decorative purposes. 　Some military units are called "flags" after their use of flags. 　A flag (Arabic: لواءcode: ara promoted to code: ar ) is equivalent to a brigade in Arab countries. 　In Spain, a flag (Spanish: banderacode: spa promoted to code: es ) is a battalion-equivalent in the Spanish Legion.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(molecular biology)>Vector (molecular biology)</a> </h2>
<p>In molecular cloning, a vector is any particle (e.g., plasmids, cosmids, Lambda phages) used as a vehicle to artificially carry a foreign nucleic sequence – usually DNA – into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed. 　A vector containing foreign DNA is termed recombinant DNA. 　The four major types of vectors are plasmids, viral vectors, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes. 　Of these, the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. 　Common to all engineered vectors have an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and a selectable marker. 　The vector itself generally carries a DNA sequence that consists of an insert (in this case the transgene) and a larger sequence that serves as the "backbone" of the vector. 　The purpose of a vector which transfers genetic information to another cell is typically to isolate, multiply, or express the insert in the target cell. 　All vectors may be used for cloning and are therefore cloning vectors, but there are also vectors designed specially for cloning, while others may be designed specifically for other purposes, such as transcription and protein expression. 　Vectors designed specifically for the expression of the transgene in the target cell are called expression vectors, and generally have a promoter sequence that drives expression of the transgene. 　Simpler vectors called transcription vectors are only capable of being transcribed but not translated: they can be replicated in a target cell but not expressed, unlike expression vectors. 　Transcription vectors are used to amplify their insert. 　The manipulation of DNA is normally conducted on E. coli vectors, which contain elements necessary for their maintenance in E. coli. 　However, vectors may also have elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism such as yeast, plant or mammalian cells, and these vectors are called shuttle vectors. 　Such vectors have bacterial or viral elements which may be transferred to the non-bacterial host organism, however other vectors termed intragenic vectors have also been developed to avoid the transfer of any genetic material from an alien species. 　Insertion of a vector into the target cell is usually called transformation for bacterial cells, transfection for eukaryotic cells, although insertion of a viral vector is often called transduction.</p>
