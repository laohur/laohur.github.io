<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October>October</a> </h2>
<p>October is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the sixth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　The eighth month in the old calendar of Romulus c. 　750 BC, October retained its name (from Latin and Greek ôctō meaning "eight") after January and February were inserted into the calendar that had originally been created by the Romans. 　In Ancient Rome, one of three Mundus patet would take place on October 5, Meditrinalia October 11, Augustalia on October 12, October Horse on October 15, and Armilustrium on October 19. 　These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. 　Among the Anglo-Saxons, it was known as Winterfylleth (Ƿinterfylleþ), because at this full moon, winter was supposed to begin. 　October is commonly associated with the season of spring in parts of the Southern Hemisphere, and autumn in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is the seasonal equivalent to April in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football>Football</a> </h2>
<p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. 　Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 　Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football. 　These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as "football codes". 　There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. 　Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. 　The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. 　By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. 　In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. 　During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song>Song</a> </h2>
<p>A song is a musical composition intended to be performed by the human voice. 　This is often done at distinct and fixed pitches (melodies) using patterns of sound and silence. 　Songs contain various forms, such as those including the repetition and variation of sections. 　Written words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. 　If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. 　Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. 　Songs composed in a simple style that are learned informally "by ear" are often referred to as folk songs. 　Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. 　These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists. 　Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. 　Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or, in some cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). 　Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas, films, and TV shows. 　A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony, although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and recitative instead. 　A song can be sung without accompaniment by instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. 　In popular music, a singer may perform with an acoustic guitarist, pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. 　In jazz, a singer may perform with a single pianist, a small combo (such as a trio or quartet), or with a big band. 　A Classical singer may perform with a single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. 　In jazz and blues, singers often learn songs "by ear" and they may improvise some melody lines. 　In Classical music, melodies are written by composers in sheet music format, so singers learn to read music. 　Songs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works. 　Songs can be broadly divided into many different forms and types, depending on the criteria used. 　Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word "song" may refer to instrumentals, such as the 20th century Songs Without Words pieces for solo piano.</p>

<p>June is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is the second of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the third of five months to have a length of less than 31 days. 　June contains the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the day with the most daylight hours, and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the day with the fewest daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). 　June in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to December in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. 　In the Northern Hemisphere, the beginning of the traditional astronomical summer is 21 June (meteorological summer begins on 1 June). 　In the Southern Hemisphere, meteorological winter begins on 1 June. 　At the start of June, the sun rises in the constellation of Taurus; at the end of June, the sun rises in the constellation of Gemini. 　However, due to the precession of the equinoxes, June begins with the sun in the astrological sign of Gemini, and ends with the sun in the astrological sign of Cancer.　[citation needed]</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country>Country</a> </h2>
<p>A country is a distinct part of the world, such as a state, nation, or other political entity. 　It may be a sovereign state or make up one part of a larger state. 　For example, the country of Japan is an independent, sovereign state, while the country of Wales is a component of a multi-part sovereign state, the United Kingdom. 　A country may be a historically sovereign area (such as Korea), a currently sovereign territory with a unified government (such as Senegal), or a non-sovereign geographic region associated with certain distinct political, ethnic, or cultural characteristics (such as the Basque Country). 　The definition and usage of the word "country" is flexible and has changed over time. 　The Economist wrote in 2010 that "any attempt to find a clear definition of a country soon runs into a thicket of exceptions and anomalies." 　Most sovereign states, but not all countries, are members of the United Nations. 　The largest country by area is Russia, while the smallest is the microstate Vatican City. 　The most populous is China, while the Pitcairn Islands are the least populous.</p>

<p>This article contains special characters. 　Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols. 　Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. 　An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. 　Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment. 　Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. 　It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals. 　In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. 　Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species. 　Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine or unconditional love (Agape). 　Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love. 　Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified "moments" currently lacking in the English language. 　Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades. 　The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel. 　The triangular theory of love suggests "intimacy, passion and commitment" are core components of love. 　Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. 　This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top>Top</a> </h2>
<p>A spinning top, or simply a top, is a toy with a squat body and a sharp point at the bottom, designed to be spun on its vertical axis, balancing on the tip due to the gyroscopic effect. 　Once set in motion, a top will usually wobble for a few seconds, spin upright for a while, then start to wobble again with increasing amplitude as it loses energy, and finally tip over and roll on its side. 　Tops exist in many variations and materials, chiefly wood, metal, and plastic, often with a metal tip. 　They may be set in motion by twirling a handle with the fingers, by pulling a rope coiled around the body, or by means of a built-in auger (spiral plunger). 　Such toys have been used since antiquity in solitary or competitive games, where each player tries to keep one's top spinning for as long as possible, or achieve some other goal. 　Some tops have faceted bodies with symbols or inscriptions, and are used like dice to inject randomness into games, or for divination and ritual purposes. 　The ubiquity of spinning tops lends to the fact that the toy is used to name many living things such as Cyclosa turbinata, whose name comes from the Latin roots for spinning top.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army>Army</a> </h2>
<p>An army, ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. 　In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or country. 　It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. 　Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. 　In some countries, such as France and China, the term "army", especially in its plural form "armies", has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. 　To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army. 　The naval force, although not using the term "army", is also included in the broad sense of the term "armies" — thus the French Navy is an integral component of the collective French Armies (French Armed Forces) under the Ministry of the Armies. 　A similar pattern is seen in China, with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) being the overall military, the land force being the PLA Ground Force, and so forth for the PLA Air Force, the PLA Navy, and other branches. 　By convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia. 　Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. 　Regular military can also refer to full-time status (standing army), versus reserve or part-time personnel. 　Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the National Defence Act), from de facto "non-statutory" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. 　Armies may also be expeditionary (designed for overseas or international deployment) or fencible (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August>August</a> </h2>
<p>August is the eighth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and the fifth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　Its zodiac sign is Leo and was originally named Sextilis in Latin because it was the 6th month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, with March being the first month of the year. 　About 700 BC, it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days. 　Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 46 BC (708 AUC), giving it its modern length of 31 days. 　In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of Emperor Augustus. 　According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt. 　Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. 　Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, August is the seasonal equivalent of February in the Northern Hemisphere. 　In the Northern Hemisphere, August falls in the season of summer. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, the month falls during the season of winter. 　In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. 　Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome. 　Certain meteor showers take place in August. 　The Kappa Cygnids take place in August, with the dates varying each year. 　The Alpha Capricornids meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10, and the Southern Delta Aquariids take place from mid-July to mid-August, with the peak usually around July 28–29. 　The Perseids, a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 and August 24, with the days of the peak varying yearly. 　The star cluster of Messier 30 is best observed around August. 　Among the aborigines of the Canary Islands, especially among the Guanches of Tenerife, the month of August received in the name of Beñesmer or Beñesmen, which was also the harvest festival held this month.</p>

<p>July is the seventh month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is the fourth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general Julius Caesar in 44 B.C., it being the month of his birth. 　Before then it was called Quintilis, being the fifth month of the calendar that started with March. 　It is on average the warmest month in most of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of summer, and the coldest month in much of the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of winter. 　The second half of the year commences in July. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, July is the seasonal equivalent of January in the Northern hemisphere. 　"Dog days" are considered to begin in early July in the Northern Hemisphere, when the hot sultry weather of summer usually starts. 　Spring lambs born in late winter or early spring are usually sold before 1 July.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door>Door</a> </h2>
<p>A door is a hinged or otherwise movable barrier that allows ingress (entry) into and egress (exit) from an enclosure. 　The created opening in the wall is a doorway or portal. 　A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide security by controlling access to the doorway (portal). 　Conventionally, it is a panel that fits into the doorway of a building, room, or vehicle. 　Doors are generally made of a material suited to the door's task. 　They are commonly attached by hinges, but can move by other means, such as slides or counterbalancing. 　The door may be able to move in various ways (at angles away from the doorway/portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress. 　In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. 　But in other cases (e.g., a vehicle door) the two sides are radically different. 　Many doors incorporate locking mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them (such as with a key). 　Doors may have devices such as knockers or doorbells by which people outside announce their presence. 　(In some countries, such as Brazil, it is customary to clap from the sidewalk to announce one's presence.) 　Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors may have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing light to pass into and out of a space, of controlling ventilation or air drafts so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening noise, and of blocking the spread of fire. 　Doors can have aesthetic, symbolic, ritualistic purposes. 　Receiving the key to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider. 　Doors and doorways frequently appear in literature and the arts with metaphorical or allegorical import as a portent of change.</p>

<p>Research is "creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge". 　It involves the collection, organization and analysis of evidence to increase understanding of a topic, characterized by a particular attentiveness to controlling sources of bias and error. 　These activities are characterized by accounting and controlling for biases. 　A research project may be an expansion on past work in the field. 　To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. 　The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. 　Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. 　There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. 　The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.</p>

<p>December is the twelfth and final month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is also the last of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　December got its name from the Latin word decem (meaning ten) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the calendar of Romulus c. 　750 BC which began in March. 　The winter days following December were not included as part of any month. 　Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name. 　In Ancient Rome, as one of the four Agonalia, this day in honour of Sol Indiges was held on December 11, as was Septimontium. 　Dies natalis (birthday) was held at the temple of Tellus on December 13, Consualia was held on December 15, Saturnalia was held December 17–23, Opiconsivia was held on December 19, Divalia was held on December 21, Larentalia was held on December 23, and the dies natalis of Sol Invictus was held on December 25. 　These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. 　The Anglo-Saxons referred to December–January as Ġēolamonaþ (modern English: "Yule month"). 　The French Republican Calendar contained December within the months of Frimaire and Nivôse.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village>Village</a> </h2>
<p>A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns), with a population typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. 　Though villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods. 　Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. 　Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. 　In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture and also for some non-agricultural societies. 　In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the right to be called a village when it built a church. 　In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population living in them. 　The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. 　This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts and development of many trades. 　The trend of urbanization continues, though not always in connection with industrialization. 　Historically homes were situated together for sociability and defiance and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed. 　Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds. 　In toponomastic terminology, the names of individual villages are called Comonyms (from Ancient Greek κώμη / village and ὄνυμα / name, [cf. ὄνομα]).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space>Space</a> </h2>
<p>Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. 　In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. 　The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. 　However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. 　Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. "space"), or in the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen. 　Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics. 　In Isaac Newton's view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space. 　Other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their distance and direction from one another. 　In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision. 　Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. 　Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his Critique of Pure Reason as being a subjective "pure a priori form of intuition". 　In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, rather than flat. 　According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. 　Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother>Mother</a> </h2>
<p>A mother is the female parent of a child. 　A woman may be considered a mother by virtue of having given birth, by raising a child who may or may not be her biological offspring, or by supplying her ovum for fertilisation in the case of gestational surrogacy. 　A biological mother is the female genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or egg donation. 　A biological mother may have legal obligations to a child not raised by her, such as an obligation of monetary support. 　An adoptive mother is a female who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption. 　A putative mother is a female whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. 　A stepmother is a woman who is married to a child's father and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child. 　A father is the male counterpart of a mother. 　Women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be, though such appellations are less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents. 　The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as "matrescence". 　The adjective "maternal" refers to a mother and comparatively to "paternal" for a father. 　The verb "to mother" means to procreate or to sire a child, or to provide care for a child, from which also derives the noun "mothering". 　Related terms of endearment are mom (mama, mommy), mum (mummy), mumsy, mamacita (ma, mam) and mammy. 　A female role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a mother-figure.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw>Saw</a> </h2>
<p>A saw is a tool consisting of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge. 　It is used to cut through material, very often wood, though sometimes metal or stone. 　The cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it forcefully forth and less vigorously back or continuously forward. 　This force may be applied by hand, or powered by steam, water, electricity or other power source. 　An abrasive saw has a powered circular blade designed to cut through metal or ceramic.</p>
