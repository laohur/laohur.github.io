<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)>Mechanism (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>In the science of biology, a mechanism is a system of causally interacting parts and processes that produce one or more effects. 　Scientists explain phenomena by describing mechanisms that could produce the phenomena. 　For example, natural selection is a mechanism of biological evolution; other mechanisms of evolution include genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow. 　In ecology, mechanisms such as predation and host-parasite interactions produce change in ecological systems. 　In practice, no description of a mechanism is ever complete because not all details of the parts and processes of a mechanism are fully known. 　For example, natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that includes countless, inter-individual interactions with other individuals, components, and processes of the environment in which natural selection operates.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(sociology)>Mechanism (sociology)</a> </h2>
<p>The term social mechanisms and mechanism-based explanations of social phenomena originate from the philosophy of science. 　The core thinking behind the mechanism approach has been expressed as follows by Elster (1989: 3-4): “To explain an event is to give an account of why it happened. Usually… this takes the form of citing an earlier event as the cause of the event we want to explain…. [But] to cite the cause is not enough: the causal mechanism must also be provided, or at least suggested.” 　Existing definitions differ a great deal from one another, but underlying them all is an emphasis on making intelligible the regularities being observed by specifying in detail how they were brought about. 　The currently most satisfactory discussion of the mechanism concept is found in Machamer, Darden and Craver (2000). 　Following them, mechanisms can be said to consist of entities (with their properties) and the activities that these entities engage in, either by themselves or in concert with other entities. 　These activities bring about change, and the type of change brought about depends upon the properties and activities of the entities and the relations between them. 　A mechanism, thus defined, refers to a constellation of entities and activities that are organized such that they regularly bring about a particular type of outcome, and we explain an observed outcome by referring to the mechanism by which such outcomes are regularly brought about (see also Hedström and Ylikoski 2010).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy>Strategy</a> </h2>
<p>Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία stratēgia, "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship") is a general plan to achieve one or more long-term or overall goals under conditions of uncertainty. 　In the sense of the "art of the general", which included several subsets of skills including military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. 　From then until the 20th century, the word "strategy" came to denote "a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact. 　Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve goals are usually limited. 　Strategy generally involves setting goals and priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. 　A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). 　Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. 　It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking. 　Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of strategy as planning, while Henrik von Scheel defines the essence of strategy as the activities to deliver a unique mix of value – choosing to perform activities differently or to perform different activities than rivals. 　while Max McKeown (2011) argues that "strategy is about shaping the future" and is the human attempt to get to "desirable ends with available means". 　Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as "a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully." 　Complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail>Trail</a> </h2>
<p>A trail, also known as a path or track, is an unpaved lane or small road usually passing through a natural area. 　In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a path or footpath is the preferred term for a pedestrian or hiking trail. 　The term is also applied in North America to routes along rivers, and sometimes to highways. 　In the US, the term was historically used for a route into or through wild territory used by explorers and migrants (e.g. the Oregon Trail). 　In the United States, "trace" is a synonym for trail, as in Natchez Trace. 　Some trails are dedicated only for walking, cycling, horse riding, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing, but not more than one use; others, as in the case of a bridleway in the UK, are multi-use and can be used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians alike. 　There are also unpaved trails used by dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles, and in some places, like the Alps, trails are used for moving cattle and other livestock.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_(Scientology)>Incident (Scientology)</a> </h2>
<p>L. Ron Hubbard used the term Incident in a specific context for auditing in Scientology and Dianetics: the description of space operatic events in the Universe's distant past, involving alien interventions in past lives. 　It is a basic belief of Scientology that a human being is an immortal spiritual being, termed a thetan, trapped on planet Earth in a "meat body". 　Although said to be capable of occurring anywhere and at any time, Hubbard's writings described some incidents in particular, set in Earth's prehistory. 　Many of them first appeared in Hubbard's book What to Audit (later retitled A History of Man). 　In his writings and lectures, Hubbard describes Incidents said to have occurred to thetans during the past few trillion years. 　Most of these followed a consistent pattern, wherein a hostile alien civilization captured and brainwashed free thetans. 　Often, instances of implantation are termed Incidents, while the subject of the implants are often termed Goals. 　Some Incidents are simply unusual and traumatic events, whereof the memory is said to linger for trillions of years. 　According to Hubbard, only Scientology's methods can remove the resulting neuroses.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket>Cricket</a> </h2>
<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. 　The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). 　Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. 　When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. 　The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 　They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information. 　Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. 　Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. 　In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. 　The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. 　It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. 　The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. 　The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. 　The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies. 　Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. 　The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.</p>

<p>Toronto (/təˈrɒntoʊ/ (listen) tə-RON-toh; locally [təˈɹɒɾ̃ə] or [ˈtɹɒɾ̃ə]) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. 　With a recorded population of 2,794,356 in 2021, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. 　The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,765,188 people (as of 2021) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a 2021 population of 6,712,341. 　Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, sports and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. 　Indigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. 　After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. 　During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops. 　York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. 　It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation. 　The city proper has since expanded past its original limits through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi). 　The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. 　More than half of residents were born outside of Canada, more than half of residents belong to a visible minority group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. 　While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city. 　The mayor of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city. 　The Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising 25 councillors since the 2018 municipal election, representing geographical wards throughout the city. 　Toronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets. 　Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. 　Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the tallest free-standing structure on land outside of Asia, the CN Tower. 　The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations. 　Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism. 　Toronto is the third-largest tech hub in North America after Silicon Valley and New York City, and the fastest growing.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid>Solid</a> </h2>
<p>Solid is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being liquid, gas, and plasma). 　The molecules in a solid are closely packed together and contain the least amount of kinetic energy. 　A solid is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to a force applied to the surface. 　Unlike a liquid, a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire available volume like a gas. 　The atoms in a solid are bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary ice), or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass). 　Solids cannot be compressed with little pressure whereas gases can be compressed with little pressure because the molecules in a gas are loosely packed. 　The branch of physics that deals with solids is called solid-state physics, and is the main branch of condensed matter physics (which also includes liquids). 　Materials science is primarily concerned with the physical and chemical properties of solids. 　Solid-state chemistry is especially concerned with the synthesis of novel materials, as well as the science of identification and chemical composition.</p>

<p>Look up stable in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A stable is a building in which livestock, especially horses, are kept. 　It most commonly means a building that is divided into separate stalls for individual animals and livestock. 　There are many different types of stables in use today; the American-style barn, for instance, is a large barn with a door at each end and individual stalls inside or free-standing stables with top and bottom-opening doors. 　The term "stable" is also used to describe a group of animals kept by one owner, regardless of housing or location. 　The exterior design of a stable can vary widely, based on climate, building materials, historical period and cultural styles of architecture. 　A wide range of building materials can be used, including masonry (bricks or stone), wood and steel. 　Stables also range widely in size, from a small building housing one or two animals to facilities at agricultural shows or race tracks that can house hundreds of animals.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerned>Concerned</a> </h2>
<p>Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman is a webcomic by Christopher C. Livingston that parodies the first-person shooter video game Half-Life 2. 　The comic is illustrated with screenshots of characters posed using Garry's Mod, a tool which allows manipulation of the Source engine used by Half-Life 2. 　The comic ran from May 2005 to November 2006 and had 205 issues. 　While Half-Life 2 follows protagonist Gordon Freeman in a dystopian future, Concerned follows "Gordon Frohman", a dangerously clumsy character who arrives in the setting of the game a few weeks before Freeman does. 　The webcomic's dark humor is derived from its contrasts with the game and through references to the game's shortcomings. 　On several occasions in the comic, Frohman becomes the cause of various disastrous circumstances that Freeman will later encounter. 　Several reviews of Concerned praised the attention to writing and presentation and the comic's humor. 　Livingston also reported positive reception from staff at Valve, the developer company of Half-Life 2, who were pleased to have a comic based on their game.</p>

<p>The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of a typical tetrapod. 　It manipulates food for mastication and swallowing as part of the digestive process, and is the primary organ of taste. 　The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. 　It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. 　The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. 　A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals. 　The human tongue is divided into two parts, an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back. 　The left and right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus, on the tongue's surface. 　There are two groups of muscles of the tongue. 　The four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to bone. 　The four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet>Planet</a> </h2>
<p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. 　The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. 　Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion. 　The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. 　These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole. 　All of them possess an atmosphere, although that of Mercury is tenuous, and some share such features as ice caps, seasons, volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology. 　Apart from Venus and Mars, the Solar System planets generate magnetic fields, and all except Venus and Mercury have natural satellites. 　The giant planets bear planetary rings, the most prominent being those of Saturn. 　The word planet probably comes from the Greek planḗtai, meaning "wanderers". 　In antiquity, this word referred to the Sun, Moon, and five points of light visible by the naked eye that moved across the background of the stars—namely, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. 　Planets have historically had religious associations: multiple cultures identified celestial bodies with gods, and these connections with mythology and folklore persist in the schemes for naming newly discovered Solar System bodies. 　Earth itself was recognized as a planet when heliocentrism supplanted geocentrism during the 16th and 17th centuries. 　With the development of the telescope, the meaning of planet broadened to include objects only visible with assistance: the ice giants Uranus and Neptune; Ceres and other bodies later recognized to be part of the asteroid belt; and Pluto, later found to be the largest member of the collection of icy bodies known as the Kuiper belt. 　The discovery of other large objects in the Kuiper belt, particularly Eris, spurred debate about how exactly to define a planet. 　The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a standard by which the four terrestrials and four giants qualify, placing Ceres, Pluto and Eris in the category of dwarf planet, although many planetary scientists have continued to apply the term planet more broadly. 　Further advances in astronomy led to the discovery of over five thousand planets outside the Solar System, termed exoplanets. 　These include hot Jupiters—giant planets that orbit close to their parent stars—like 51 Pegasi b, super-Earths like Gliese 581c that have masses in between that of Earth and Neptune; and planets smaller than Earth, like Kepler-20e. 　Multiple exoplanets have been found to orbit in the habitable zones of their stars, but Earth remains the only planet known to support life.</p>

<p>Coordinates: 10°S 52°W﻿ / ﻿10°S 52°W﻿ / -10; -52 Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil; Brazilian Portuguese: [bɾaˈziw] (listen)), officially the Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: República Federativa do Brasil), is the largest country in South America and in Latin America. 　At 8.5 million square kilometers (3,300,000 sq mi) and with over 217 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous. 　Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. 　The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. 　It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language. 　It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world, and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country. 　Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi). 　It borders all other countries and territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers roughly half of the continent's land area. 　Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. 　This unique environmental heritage positions Brazil at number one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss. 　The territory which would become known as Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the discovered land for the Portuguese Empire. 　Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. 　In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. 　Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. 　The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. 　Slavery was abolished in 1888. 　The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. 　An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. 　Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic. 　Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　A major non-NATO ally of the United States, Brazil is a regional and middle power, and is also classified as an emerging power. 　Categorised as developing country with a high Human Development Index, Brazil is considered an advanced emerging economy, having the twelfth largest GDP in the world by nominal, and ninth by PPP measures, the largest in Latin America. 　As an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank and a newly industrialized country, Brazil has the largest share of global wealth in South America and it is one of the world's major breadbaskets, being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years. 　However, the country retains noticeable corruption, crime and social inequality. 　Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry>Poetry</a> </h2>
<p>Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, "making"), also called verse, is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic qualities of language − such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre − to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, a prosaic ostensible meaning. 　A poem is a literary composition, written by a poet, using this principle. 　Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the globe. 　It dates back at least to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys. 　Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE. 　The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian. 　Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, as well as religious hymns (the Sanskrit Rigveda, the Zoroastrian Gathas, the Hurrian songs, and the Hebrew Psalms); or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Egyptian Story of Sinuhe, the Indian epic poetry, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. 　Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. 　Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form, and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative prosaic writing. 　Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretations of words, or to evoke emotive responses. 　Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and rhythm may convey musical or incantatory effects. 　The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony, and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. 　Similarly, figures of speech such as metaphor, simile, and metonymy establish a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. 　Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm. 　Some poetry types are unique to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. 　Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz, or Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter. 　There are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. 　Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, testing the principle of euphony itself or altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. 　In an increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles, and techniques from diverse cultures and languages. 　Poets have contributed to the evolution of the linguistic, expressive, and utilitarian qualities of their languages. 　A Western cultural tradition (extending at least from Homer to Rilke) associates the production of poetry with inspiration – often by a Muse (either classical or contemporary). 　In many poems, the lyrics are spoken by a character, who is called the speaker. 　This concept differentiates the speaker (character) from the poet (author), which is usually an important distinction: for example, if the poem runs "I killed a man in Reno", it is the speaker who is the murderer, not the poet himself.</p>

<p>The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates. 　The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital organ in the digestive system. 　The stomach is involved in the gastric phase of digestion, following chewing. 　It performs a chemical breakdown by means of enzymes and hydrochloric acid. 　In humans and many other animals, the stomach is located between the esophagus and the small intestine. 　The stomach secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. 　The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of intestines.</p>

<p>A suit, lounge suit, or business suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket and trousers of identical textiles worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes. 　A skirt suit is similar, but with a matching skirt instead of trousers. 　It is considered informal wear in Western dress codes. 　The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as a more casual alternative for sportswear and British country clothing, with roots in early modern Western Europe. 　After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-colored suit became known as a lounge suit. 　Suits are offered in different designs and constructions. 　Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories. 　A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat. 　Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture. 　Informal suits have been traditionally worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap. 　Other accessories include handkerchief, suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry. 　Other notable types of suits are for semi-formal occasions—the dinner suit (black tie) and the black lounge suit (stroller)—both which arose as less formal alternatives for the formal wear of the dress coat for white tie, and the morning coat with formal trousers for morning dress, respectively. 　Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client's selected cloth. 　These are now known as bespoke suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style preferences. 　Since the 1960s, most suits are mass-produced ready-to-wear garments. 　Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways: bespoke, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer's measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric; made to measure, in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available; ready-to-wear, off-the-peg (Commonwealth English), or off-the-rack (American English), which is sold as is, although some tailor alteration tends to be required; suit separates, where lounge jacket and trousers are sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, including also odd-colored blazers or sports coats as smart casual options</p>

<p>A cemetery is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or interred, it is a type of burial ground. 　The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον, means "sleeping place") implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs. 　The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard. 　The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an "above-ground grave" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice. 　In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries. 　These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs. 　Modern cemeteries often include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both, continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey>Grey</a> </h2>
<p>Look up grey or gray in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　Grey (more common in British English) or gray (more common in American English) is an intermediate color between black and white. 　It is a neutral or achromatic color, meaning literally that it is "without color", because it can be composed of black and white. 　It is the color of a cloud-covered sky, of ash and of lead. 　The first recorded use of grey as a color name in the English language was in 700 CE. 　Grey is the dominant spelling in European and Commonwealth English, while gray has been the preferred spelling in American English; both spellings are valid in both varieties of English. 　In Europe and North America, surveys show that grey is the color most commonly associated with neutrality, conformity, boredom, uncertainty, old age, indifference, and modesty. 　Only one percent of respondents chose it as their favorite color.</p>
