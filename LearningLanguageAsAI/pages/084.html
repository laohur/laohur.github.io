<p>Majesty (abbreviated HM for His Majesty or Her Majesty, oral address Your Majesty; from the Latin maiestas, meaning "greatness") is used as a manner of address by many monarchs, usually kings or queens. 　Where used, the style outranks the style of (Imperial/Royal) Highness, but is inferior to the style of Imperial Majesty. 　It has cognates in many other languages, especially of Europe.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian>Adrian</a> </h2>
<p>Adrian is a form of the Latin given name Adrianus or Hadrianus. 　Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river Adria from the Venetic and Illyrian word adur, meaning "sea" or "water". 　The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the Po River into the Adriatic Sea but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. 　Hecataeus of Miletus (c.550 – c.476 　BC) asserted that both the Etruscan harbor city of Adria and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it. 　Emperor Hadrian's family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now Atri, in Picenum, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name. 　Several saints and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. 　As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages, although it did not become common until modern times.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter>Twitter</a> </h2>
<p>Twitter is an online social media and social networking service owned and operated by American company Twitter, Inc., on which users send and respond publicly or privately texts, images and videos known as "tweets". 　Registered users can tweet, like, 'retweet' tweets and direct message (DM), while unregistered users only have the ability to view public tweets. 　Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its APIs. 　Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. 　Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California and has more than 25 offices around the world. 　By 2012[update], more than 100 million users tweeted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. 　In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet". 　By the start of 2019[update], Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. 　In practice, the vast majority of tweets are tweeted by a minority of users. 　In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were fake. 　On October 27, 2022, business magnate Elon Musk acquired Twitter, Inc. for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform. 　On December 20, 2022, Musk announced he would step down as CEO once a replacement had been found.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher>Pitcher</a> </h2>
<p>In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws ("pitches") the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. 　In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. 　The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. 　There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer. 　Traditionally, the pitcher also bats. 　Starting in 1973 with the American League (and later the National League) and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter, a cause of some controversy. 　The Japanese Central League has not adopted the designated hitter position.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel>Barrel</a> </h2>
<p>A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide. 　They are traditionally made of wooden staves and bound by wooden or metal hoops. 　The word vat is often used for large containers for liquids, usually alcoholic beverages; a small barrel or cask is known as a keg. 　Modern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (Quercus robur), white oak (Quercus petraea), American white oak (Quercus alba), more exotic is Mizunara Oak all typically have standard sizes: Recently Oregon Oak (Quercus Garryana) has been used. 　"Bordeaux type" 225 litres (59 US gal; 49 imp gal), "Burgundy type" 228 litres (60 US gal; 50 imp gal) and "Cognac type" 300 litres (79 US gal; 66 imp gal). 　Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different types of plastic, such as HDPE. 　Someone who makes barrels is called a "barrel maker" or cooper (coopers also make buckets, vats, tubs, butter churns, hogsheads, firkins, kegs, kilderkins, tierces, rundlets, puncheons, pipes, tuns, butts, pins, troughs and breakers). 　Barrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol. 　They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as wine, cognac, armagnac, sherry, port, whiskey, beer, arrack, and sake. 　Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include gunpowder, meat, fish, paint, honey, nails and tallow. 　Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space. 　The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers or drums made of modern materials like plastic, steel or aluminium. 　The barrel has also been used as a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. 　For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of 36 imperial gallons (160 L; 43 US gal). 　Wine was shipped in barrels of 119 litres (31 US gal; 26 imp gal). 　A barrel of oil, defined as 42 US gallons (35 imp gal; 160 L), is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels. 　The barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(horology)>Barrel (horology)</a> </h2>
<p>Used in mechanical watches and clocks, a barrel is a cylindrical metal box closed by a cover, with a ring of gear teeth around it, containing a spiral spring called the mainspring, which provides power to run the timepiece. 　The barrel turns on an arbor (axle). 　The spring is hooked to the barrel at its outer end and to the arbor at its inner end. 　The barrel teeth engage the first pinion of the wheel train of the watch, usually the center wheel. 　Barrels rotate slowly: for a watch mainspring barrel, the rate is usually one rotation every 8 hours. 　This construction allows the mainspring to be wound (by turning the arbour) without interrupting the tension of the spring driving the timepiece.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest>Nest</a> </h2>
<p>A nest is a structure built for certain animals to hold eggs or young. 　Although nests are most closely associated with birds, members of all classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates construct nests. 　They may be composed of organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves, or may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a rock, tree, or building. 　Human-made materials, such as string, plastic, cloth, or paper, may also be used. 　Nests can be found in all types of habitat. 　Nest building is driven by a biological urge known as the nesting instinct in birds and mammals. 　Generally each species has a distinctive style of nest. 　Nest complexity is roughly correlated with the level of parental care by adults. 　Nest building is considered a key adaptive advantage among birds, and they exhibit the most variation in their nests ranging from simple holes in the ground to elaborate communal nests hosting hundreds of individuals. 　Nests of prairie dogs and several social insects can host millions of individuals.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination>Imagination</a> </h2>
<p>Imagination is the production or simulation of novel objects, sensations, and ideas in the mind without any immediate input of the senses. 　Stefan Szczelkun characterises it as the forming of experiences in one's mind, which can be re-creations of past experiences, such as vivid memories with imagined changes, or completely invented and possibly fantastic scenes. 　Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. 　As an approach to build theory, it is called "disciplined imagination". 　A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to "evoke worlds". 　One view of imagination links it with cognition, seeing imagination as a cognitive process used in mental functioning. 　It is increasingly used - in the form of visual imagery - by clinicians in psychological treatment. 　Imaginative thought may - speculatively - become associated with rational thought on the assumption that both activities may involve cognitive processes that may "underpin thinking about possibilities". 　The cognate term, "mental imagery" may be used in psychology for denoting the process of reviving in the mind recollections of objects formerly given in sense perception. 　Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "imaging" or "imagery" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. 　Constructive imagination is further divided into voluntary imagination driven by the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and involuntary imagination (LPFC-independent), such as REM-sleep dreaming, daydreaming, hallucinations, and spontaneous insight. 　The voluntary types of imagination include integration of modifiers, and mental rotation. 　Imagined images, both novel and recalled, are seen with the "mind's eye". 　Imagination, however, is not considered to be exclusively a cognitive activity because it is also linked to the body and place, particularly that it also involves setting up relationships with materials and people, precluding the sense that imagination is locked away in the head. 　Imagination can also be expressed through stories such as fairy tales or fantasies. 　Children often use such narratives and pretend play in order to exercise their imaginations. 　When children develop fantasy they play at two levels: first, they use role playing to act out what they have developed with their imagination, and at the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting as if what they have developed is an actual reality.</p>

<p>Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. 　Depending upon the distance from and nature of the lightning, it can range from a long, low rumble to a sudden, loud crack. 　The sudden increase in temperature and hence pressure caused by the lightning produces rapid expansion of the air in the path of a lightning bolt. 　In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, often referred to as a "thunderclap" or "peal of thunder". 　The scientific study of thunder is known as brontology and the irrational fear (phobia) of thunder is called brontophobia.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese>Cheese</a> </h2>
<p>Cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. 　It comprises proteins and fat from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep). 　During production, milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. 　The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese. 　Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. 　Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are produced in various countries. 　Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged. 　Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. 　The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto. 　Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives, or cranberries. 　A cheesemonger, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening cheeses. 　For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. 　Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. 　Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family. 　Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs. 　Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. 　Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese. 　Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. 　The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. 　Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century. 　Plant-based cheese has a lower carbon footprint.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield>Sheffield</a> </h2>
<p>Sheffield is a city in South Yorkshire, England, whose name derives from the River Sheaf which runs through it. 　The city serves as the administrative centre of the City of Sheffield. 　It is historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire and some of its southern suburbs were transferred from Derbyshire to the city council. 　It is the largest settlement in South Yorkshire. 　The city is in the eastern foothills of the Pennines and the valleys of the River Don with its four tributaries: the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin and the Sheaf. 　Sixty-one per cent of Sheffield's entire area is green space and a third of the city lies within the Peak District national park. 　There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city, which is estimated to contain around 4.5 million trees. 　The city is 29 miles (47 km) south of Leeds, 32 miles (51 km) east of Manchester, and 33 miles (53 km) north of Nottingham. 　Sheffield played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, with many significant inventions and technologies having developed in the city. 　In the 19th century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when stainless steel and crucible steel were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. 　Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. 　International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area. 　The Yorkshire ridings became counties in their own right in 1889, the West Riding of Yorkshire county was disbanded in 1974. 　The city then became part of the county of South Yorkshire; this has been made up of separately-governed unitary authorities since 1986. 　The 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment in Sheffield, consistent with other British cities. 　Sheffield's gross value added (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £11.3 billion in 2015. 　The economy has experienced steady growth, averaging around 5% annually, which is greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber. 　Sheffield had a population of 556,500 at the 2021 census, making it the second largest city in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. 　The Sheffield Built-up Area, of which the Sheffield sub-division is the largest part, had a population of 685,369 also including the town of Rotherham. 　The district borough, governed from the city, had a population of 556,521 at the mid-2019 estimate, making it the 4th most populous district in England. 　It is one of eleven British cities that make up the Core Cities Group. 　In 2011, the unparished area had a population of 490,070. 　The city has a long sporting heritage and is home both to the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C., and the world's oldest football ground, Sandygate. 　Matches between the two professional clubs, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, are known as the Steel City derby. 　The city is also home to the World Snooker Championship and the Sheffield Steelers, the UK's first professional ice hockey team.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia>Encyclopedia</a> </h2>
<p>An encyclopedia (American English) or encyclopædia (British English) is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or discipline. 　Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable. 　Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. 　Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms. 　Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably during that time as regards language (written in a major international or a vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge), cultural perspective (authoritative, ideological, didactic, utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership (education level, background, interests, capabilities), and the technologies available for their production and distribution (hand-written manuscripts, small or large print runs, Internet). 　As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts, printed versions found a prominent place in libraries, schools and other educational institutions. 　The appearance of digital and open-source versions in the 21st century, such as Wikipedia, has vastly expanded the accessibility, authorship, readership, and variety of encyclopedia entries.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger>Hunger</a> </h2>
<p>In politics, humanitarian aid, and the social sciences, hunger is defined as a condition in which a person does not have the physical or financial capability to eat sufficient food to meet basic nutritional needs for a sustained period. 　In the field of hunger relief, the term hunger is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience, also known as an appetite. 　The most extreme form of hunger, when malnutrition is widespread, and when people have started dying of starvation through lack of access to sufficient, nutritious food, leads to a declaration of famine. 　Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. 　In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. 　In the decades following World War II, technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. 　While progress was uneven, by 2014, the threat of extreme hunger had receded for a large portion of the world's population. 　According to the FAO's 2021 The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger began to rise gradually between 2014 and 2019. 　In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a massive increase, resulting in nearly 770 million people suffering from malnutrition. 　While most of the world's people continue to live in Asia, much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in Africa and South America. 　The FAO's 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: climate, conflict, and economic slowdowns. 　The 2018 edition focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rising rates to be especially severe in countries where agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme weather variations. 　The 2019 SOFI report found a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an economic slowdown. 　The 2020 edition instead looked at the prospects of achieving the hunger related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). 　It warned that if nothing was done to counter the adverse trends of the past six years, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger could rise by over 150 million by 2030. 　The 2021 report reported a sharp jump in hunger caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 　Many thousands of organizations are engaged in the field of hunger relief, operating at local, national, regional, or international levels. 　Some of these organizations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in several different fields. 　The organizations range from multilateral institutions to national governments, to small local initiatives such as independent soup kitchens. 　Many participate in umbrella networks that connect thousands of different hunger relief organizations. 　At the global level, much of the world's hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the UN and geared towards achieving SDG 2 of Zero Hunger by 2030.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_(physiology)>Hunger (physiology)</a> </h2>
<p>Hunger is a sensation that motivates the consumption of food. 　The sensation of hunger typically manifests after only a few hours without eating and is generally considered to be unpleasant. 　Satiety occurs between 5 and 20 minutes after eating. 　There are several theories about how the feeling of hunger arises. 　The desire to eat food, or appetite, is another sensation experienced with regards to eating. 　The term hunger is also the most commonly used in social science and policy discussions to describe the condition of people who suffer from a chronic lack of sufficient food and constantly or frequently experience the sensation of hunger, and can lead to malnutrition. 　A healthy, well-nourished individual can survive for weeks without food intake (see fasting), with claims ranging from three to ten weeks. 　Satiety is the opposite of hunger; it is the sensation of feeling full.</p>

<p>Different types of pins A pin is a device used for fastening objects or fabrics together and can have three sorts of body: a shaft of a rigid inflexible material meant to be inserted in a slot, groove, or hole (as with pivots, hinges, and jigs); a shaft connected to a head and ending in a sharp tip meant to pierce one or more pieces of soft materials like cloth or paper (the straight or push pin); a single strip of a rigid but flexible material (e.g. a wire) whose length has been folded into parallel prongs in such fashion that the middle length of each curves towards the other so that, when anything is inserted between them, they act as a clamp (e.g. the bobby pin), or two strips of a rigid material bound together by a spring at one end so that, when the spring held open, one can insert some material between the prongs at the other end that, the spring allowed to close, then clamp the inserted material. 　According to their function, pins can be made of metals (e.g. steel, copper, or brass), wood, or plastic.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition>Decomposition</a> </h2>
<p>Decomposition or rot is the process by which dead organic substances are broken down into simpler organic or inorganic matter such as carbon dioxide, water, simple sugars and mineral salts. 　The process is a part of the nutrient cycle and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biosphere. 　Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. 　Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. 　Organisms that do this are known as decomposers or detritivores. 　Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition. 　The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as taphonomy from the Greek word taphos, meaning tomb. 　Decomposition can also be a gradual process for organisms that have extended periods of dormancy. 　One can differentiate abiotic decomposition from biotic decomposition (biodegradation). 　The former means "the degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes", e.g., hydrolysis; the latter means "the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms", typically by microorganisms.</p>

<p>A melody (from Greek μελῳδία, melōidía, "singing, chanting"), also tune, voice or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. 　In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include other musical elements such as tonal color. 　It is the foreground to the background accompaniment. 　A line or part need not be a foreground melody. 　Melodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs, and are usually repeated throughout a composition in various forms. 　Melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape.</p>

<p>In mathematics, topology (from the Greek words τόπος, 'place, location' and λόγος, 'study') concerns with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself. 　A topological space is a set endowed with a structure, called a topology, which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of continuity. 　Euclidean spaces, and, more generally, metric spaces are examples of a topological space, as any distance or metric defines a topology. 　The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies. 　A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property. 　Basic examples of topological properties are: the dimension, which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface; compactness, which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle; connectedness, which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles. 　The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs. 　Leonhard Euler's Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field's first theorems. 　The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay>Essay</a> </h2>
<p>An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument, but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a letter, a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. 　Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc. 　Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. 　Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). 　While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples. 　In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. 　Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams. 　The concept of an "essay" has been extended to other media beyond writing. 　A film essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. 　A photographic essay covers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying text or captions.</p>
