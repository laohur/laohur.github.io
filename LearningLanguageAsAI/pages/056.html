<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal>Portugal</a> </h2>
<p>Portugal (Portuguese pronunciation: [puɾtuˈɣal]), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: República Portuguesa [ʁɛˈpuβlikɐ puɾtuˈɣezɐ]), is a country located on the Iberian Peninsula, in southwestern Europe, and whose territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira. 　It features the westernmost point in continental Europe, and its Iberian portion is bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain, the sole country to have a land border with Portugal. 　Its two archipelagos form two autonomous regions with their own regional governments. 　Lisbon is the capital and largest city by population. 　One of the oldest countries in Europe, its territory has been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since prehistoric times. 　The territory was first inhabited by pre-Roman and Celtic peoples (at the time of the first large-scale Roman invasions in Western Iberia, they preponderantly were the Lusitanians, the Gallaecians, the Celtici and, to some extent, the Conii). 　These peoples had contact with Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and Carthaginians. 　It was later ruled by the Romans, followed by the invasions of Germanic peoples (most prominently, the Suebi and the Visigoths) together with the Alans, and the Islamic invasion the Umayyad Caliphate, whose rule were eventually expelled during the Reconquista. 　Founded first as a county within the Kingdom of León in 868, the country officially gained its independence as the Kingdom of Portugal with the Treaty of Zamora in 1143. 　In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal established one of the longest-lived maritime and commercial empires, becoming one of the main economic and political powers of the time. 　At the end of the 16th century, however, Portugal suffered a war for the crown succession which led to the incorporation of the country into the Spanish monarchy during the Iberian Union. 　By the early 19th century, the accumulative crisis, events such as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the country's occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the resulting independence of Brazil in 1822 led to a marked decay of Portugal's prior opulence. 　This was followed by the civil war between liberal constitutionalists and conservative absolutists over royal succession, which lasted from 1828 to 1834. 　The 1910 revolution deposed Portugal's centuries-old monarchy, and established the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic, later being superseded by the Estado Novo (New State) authoritarian regime. 　Democracy was restored after the Carnation Revolution (1974), ending the Portuguese Colonial War and eventually losing its remanent colonial possessions. 　Portugal has left a profound cultural, architectural and linguistic influence across the globe, with a legacy of around 250 million Portuguese speakers around the world. 　It is a developed country with an advanced economy which holds the 14th largest gold reserve at its national central bank, the 8th largest proven reserves of lithium, with the weight of exports representing 49% of its GDP in 2022 and high living standards. 　Additionally, it ranks highly in peacefulness, democracy, press freedom, stability, social progress, prosperity and English proficiency. 　A member of the United Nations, the European Union, the Schengen Area and the Council of Europe (CoE), Portugal was also one of the founding members of NATO, the eurozone, the OECD, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent>Parent</a> </h2>
<p>A parent is a caregiver of the offspring in their own species. 　In humans, a parent is the caretaker of a child (where "child" refers to offspring, not necessarily age). 　A biological parent is a person whose gamete resulted in a child, a male through the sperm, and a female through the ovum. 　Biological parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet. 　A female can also become a parent through surrogacy. 　Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child. 　Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members. 　A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation. 　With recent medical advances, it is possible to have more than two biological parents. 　Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients' genetic material. 　The most common types of parents are mothers, fathers, step-parents, and grandparents. 　A mother is, "a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth." 　The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent to be involved in their offspring's life varies from culture to culture, however one that exhibits too little involvement is sometimes said to exhibit child neglect, while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective, cosseting, nosey, or intrusive.</p>

<p>A kick is a physical strike using the leg, in unison usually with an area of the knee or lower using the foot, heel, tibia (shin), ball of the foot, blade of the foot, toes or knee (the latter is also known as a knee strike). 　This type of attack is used frequently by hooved animals as well as humans in the context of stand-up fighting. 　Kicks play a significant role in many forms of martial arts, such as capoeira, kalaripayattu, karate, kickboxing, kung fu, MMA, Muay thai, pankration, pradal serey, savate, sikaran, silat, taekwondo, vovinam, and Yaw-Yan. 　Kicks are a universal act of aggression among humans. 　Kicking is also prominent from its use in many sports, especially those called football. 　The best known of these sports is association football, also known as soccer.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling>Ceiling</a> </h2>
<p>A ceiling /ˈsiːlɪŋ/ is an overhead interior surface that covers the upper limits of a room. 　It is not generally considered a structural element, but a finished surface concealing the underside of the roof structure or the floor of a story above. 　Ceilings can be decorated to taste, and there are many fine examples of frescoes and artwork on ceilings especially in religious buildings. 　A ceiling can also be the upper limit of a tunnel. 　The most common type of ceiling is the dropped ceiling, which is suspended from structural elements above. 　Panels of drywall are fastened either directly to the ceiling joists or to a few layers of moisture-proof plywood which are then attached to the joists. 　Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling, and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. 　Alternatively, ceilings may be spray painted instead, leaving the pipework and ducts exposed but painted, and using spray foam. 　A subset of the dropped ceiling is the suspended ceiling, wherein a network of aluminum struts, as opposed to drywall, are attached to the joists, forming a series of rectangular spaces. 　Individual pieces of cardboard are then placed inside the bottom of those spaces so that the outer side of the cardboard, interspersed with aluminum rails, is seen as the ceiling from below. 　This makes it relatively easy to repair the pipes and insulation behind the ceiling, since all that is necessary is to lift off the cardboard, rather than digging through the drywall and then replacing it. 　Other types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling, the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling, the stretched ceiling and the coffered ceiling. 　Coving often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls. 　Ceilings can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of dropped ceilings.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy>Democracy</a> </h2>
<p>Democracy (From Ancient Greek: δημοκρατία, romanized: dēmokratía, dēmos 'people' and kratos 'rule') is a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation ("direct democracy"), or to choose governing officials to do so ("representative democracy"). 　Who is considered part of "the people" and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries. 　Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, property rights, freedom of religion and speech, inclusiveness and equality, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights. 　The notion of democracy has evolved over time considerably. 　Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. 　Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. 　Prevalent day-to-day decision making of democracies is the majority rule, though other decision making approaches like supermajority and consensus have also been integral to democracies. 　They serve the crucial purpose of inclusiveness and broader legitimacy on sensitive issues—counterbalancing majoritarianism—and therefore mostly take precedence on a constitutional level. 　In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority—usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e.g. freedom of speech or freedom of association. 　The term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean "rule of the people", in contrast to aristocracy (ἀριστοκρατία, aristokratía), meaning "rule of an elite". 　Western democracy, as distinct from that which existed in antiquity, is generally considered to have originated in city-states such as those in Classical Athens and the Roman Republic, where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in the West at the beginning of late antiquity. 　In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. 　In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 　Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in autocratic systems like absolute monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy—oppositions inherited from ancient Greek philosophy. 　Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 　World public opinion strongly favors democratic systems of government. 　According to the V-Dem Institute and Economist Intelligence Unit democracy indices, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2021. 　Democratic backsliding with a rise in hybrid regimes has exceeded democratization since the early to mid 2010s.</p>

<p>In humans and other primates, the knee joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two joints: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). 　It is the largest joint in the human body. 　The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. 　The knee is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis. 　It is often termed a compound joint having tibiofemoral and patellofemoral components. 　(The fibular collateral ligament is often considered with tibiofemoral components.)</p>

<p>Liverpool is a city and metropolitan borough in North West England. 　With a population of 486,100 in 2021, it is located within the county of Merseyside and is the principal city of the wider Liverpool City Region. 　Its metropolitan area is the fifth largest in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2.24 million. 　On the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, Liverpool historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the county of Lancashire. 　It became a borough in 1207, a city in 1880, and a county borough independent of the newly-created Lancashire County Council in 1889. 　Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. 　Along with general cargo, freight, and raw materials such as coal and cotton, merchants were involved in the slave trade. 　In the 19th century, Liverpool was a major port of departure for English and Irish emigrants to North America. 　It was also home to both the Cunard and White Star Lines, and was the port of registry of the ocean liners RMS Titanic, RMS Lusitania, RMS Queen Mary, RMS Queen Elizabeth and RMS Olympic. 　In 2019, Liverpool was the fifth most visited UK city. 　It is noted for its culture, architecture, and transport links. 　The city is closely associated with the arts, especially music. 　The popularity of the Beatles, widely regarded as the most influential band of all time, led to it becoming a tourist destination. 　Liverpool has continued to be the home of numerous notable musicians and record labels—musicians from the city have released 56 No. 1 hit singles, more than any other city in the world. 　The city also has a long-standing reputation for producing countless actors and actresses, artists, athletes, comedians, journalists, novelists, and poets. 　Liverpool has the second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and listed parks in the UK; only the capital, London, has more. 　The former Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City includes the Pier Head, Albert Dock and William Brown Street. 　In sport, the city is best known as the home of Premier League football teams Liverpool FC and Everton FC, with matches between the two rivals being known as the Merseyside derby. 　The annual Grand National horse race takes place at Aintree Racecourse. 　Several areas of Liverpool city centre carried World Heritage Site status from 2004 until 2021; the city's vast collection of parks and open spaces has been described as the "most important in the country" by England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest. 　Its status as a port city historically attracted a diverse population from a wide range of cultures, primarily Ireland, Norway, and Wales. 　It is also home to the oldest black community in the UK and the oldest Chinese community in Europe. 　Natives of Liverpool (and some longtime residents from elsewhere) are formally referred to as "Liverpudlians" but are usually called "Scousers" in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city; "Scouse" is also the most common name for the Liverpool accent and dialect. 　The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007 and was named the 2008 European Capital of Culture, which it shared with the Norwegian city of Stavanger. 　Its selection as a European Capital of Culture has been credited with kickstarting its economic renaissance.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant>Merchant</a> </h2>
<p>A merchant is a person who trades in commodities produced by other people, especially one who trades with foreign countries. 　Historically, a merchant is anyone who is involved in business or trade. 　Merchants have operated for as long as industry, commerce, and trade have existed. 　In 16th-century Europe, two different terms for merchants emerged: meerseniers referred to local traders (such as bakers and grocers) and koopman (Dutch: koopman) referred to merchants who operated on a global stage, importing and exporting goods over vast distances and offering added-value services such as credit and finance. 　The status of the merchant has varied during different periods of history and among different societies. 　In modern times, the term merchant has occasionally been used to refer to a businessperson or someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating profit, cash flow, sales, and revenue using a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical capital with a view to fueling economic development and growth. 　Merchants have been known for as long as humans have engaged in trade and commerce. 　Merchants and merchant networks operated in ancient Babylonia and Assyria, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Phoenicia, and Rome. 　During the European medieval period, a rapid expansion in trade and commerce led to the rise of a wealthy and powerful merchant class. 　The European age of discovery opened up new trading routes and gave European consumers access to a much broader range of goods. 　From the 1600s, goods began to travel much further distances as they found their way into geographically dispersed market-places. 　Following the opening of Asia to European trade and the discovery of the New World, merchants imported goods over very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. 　By the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant had started to emerge and modern business practices were becoming evident.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozen>Dozen</a> </h2>
<p>A dozen (commonly abbreviated doz or dz) is a grouping of twelve. 　The dozen may be one of the earliest primitive integer groupings, perhaps because there are approximately a dozen cycles of the Moon, or months, in a cycle of the Sun, or year. 　Twelve is convenient because it has a maximal number of divisors among the numbers up to its double, a property only true of 1, 2, 6, 12, 60, 360, and 2520. 　The use of twelve as a base number, known as the duodecimal system (also as dozenal), originated in Mesopotamia (see also sexagesimal). 　Counting in base-12 can easily be accomplished on one's hands by counting each finger bone with one's thumb. 　Using this method, one hand can count to twelve, and two hands (with the second hand as a placeholder for representing units of twelve) can count to 144. 　Twelve dozen (122 = 144) are known as a gross; and twelve gross (123 = 1,728, the duodecimal 1,000) are called a great gross, a term most often used when shipping or buying items in bulk. 　A great hundred, also known as a small gross, is 120 or ten dozen. 　Dozen may also be used to express a moderately large quantity as in "several dozen" (e.g., dozens of people came to the party). 　Varying by country, some products are packaged or sold by the dozen, often foodstuff (a dozen eggs).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk>Milk</a> </h2>
<p>Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. 　It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. 　Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. 　Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. 　Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose. 　As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals. 　In 2011, dairy farms produced around 730 million tonnes (800 million short tons) of milk from 260 million dairy cows. 　India is the world's largest producer of milk and the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, but it exports few other milk products. 　Because there is an ever-increasing demand for dairy products within India, it could eventually become a net importer of dairy products. 　New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products. 　The US CDC recommends that children over the age of 12 months should have two servings of dairy milk products a day. 　More than six billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products, and between 750 and 900 million people live in dairy-farming households.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive>Archive</a> </h2>
<p>An archive is an accumulation of historical records or materials – in any medium – or the physical facility in which they are located. 　Archives contain primary source documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization's lifetime, and are kept to show the function of that person or organization. 　Professional archivists and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. 　They have been metaphorically defined as "the secretions of an organism", and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity. 　In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. 　Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines of which many identical copies may exist. 　This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings. 　A person who works in archives is called an archivist. 　The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called archival science. 　The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive (more usual in the United Kingdom), an archives (more usual in the United States), or a repository. 　The computing use of the term "archive" should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship>Friendship</a> </h2>
<p>Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people. 　It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an "acquaintance" or an "association", such as a classmate, neighbor, coworker, or colleague. 　In some cultures, the concept of friendship is restricted to a small number of very deep relationships; in others, such as the U.S. and Canada, a person could have many friends, and perhaps a more intense relationship with one or two people, who may be called good friends or best friends. 　Other colloquial terms include besties or Best Friends Forever (BFFs). 　Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many such bonds. 　Such features include choosing to be with one another, enjoying time spent together, and being able to engage in a positive and supportive role to one another. 　Sometimes friends are distinguished from family, as in the saying "friends and family", and sometimes from lovers (e.g., "lovers and friends"), although the line is blurred with friends with benefits. 　Similarly, the friend zone is a term for when someone is restricted from rising up to the status of lover, hence the name (see also Unrequited love). 　Friendship has been studied in academic fields, such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. 　Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography>Photography</a> </h2>
<p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. 　It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. 　Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. 　With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. 　The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. 　A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>

<p>Baltimore (/ˈbɔːltɪmɔːr/ BAWL-tim-or, locally: /bɔːldəˈmɔːr/ bawl-da-MOR or /ˈbɔːlmər/ BAWL-mər) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maryland, the fourth most populous city in the Mid-Atlantic, and the 30th most populous city in the United States with a population of 585,708 in 2020. 　Baltimore was designated an independent city by the Constitution of Maryland in 1851, and today it is the most populous independent city in the nation. 　As of 2021, the population of the Baltimore metropolitan area was estimated to be 2,838,327, making it the nation's 20th largest metropolitan area. 　Baltimore is located about 40 miles (64 km) north northeast of Washington, D.C., making it a principal city in the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area (CSA), the third-largest CSA in the nation, with a 2021 estimated population of 9,946,526. 　Prior to European colonization, the Baltimore region was used as hunting grounds by the Susquehannock Native Americans, who were primarily settled further northwest than where the city was later built. 　Colonists from the Province of Maryland established the Port of Baltimore in 1706 to support the tobacco trade with Europe, and established the Town of Baltimore in 1729. 　The first printing press and newspapers were introduced to Baltimore by Nicholas Hasselbach and William Goddard respectively, in the mid-18th century. 　The Battle of Baltimore was a pivotal engagement during the War of 1812, culminating in the failed British bombardment of Fort McHenry, during which Francis Scott Key wrote a poem that would become "The Star-Spangled Banner", which was eventually designated as the American national anthem in 1931. 　During the Pratt Street Riot of 1861, the city was the site of some of the earliest violence associated with the American Civil War. 　The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the oldest railroad in the United States, was built in 1830 and cemented Baltimore's status as a major transportation hub, giving producers in the Midwest and Appalachia access to the city's port. 　Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States. 　In addition, Baltimore was a major manufacturing center. 　After a decline in major manufacturing, heavy industry, and restructuring of the rail industry, Baltimore has shifted to a service-oriented economy. 　Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University are the city's top two employers. 　Baltimore and its surrounding region are home to the headquarters of a number of major organizations and government agencies, including the NAACP, ABET, the National Federation of the Blind, Catholic Relief Services, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, World Relief, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Social Security Administration. 　Baltimore is also home to the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball and the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. 　Many of Baltimore's neighborhoods have rich histories. 　The city is home to some of the earliest National Register Historic Districts in the nation, including Fell's Point, Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon. 　These were added to the National Register between 1969 and 1971, soon after historic preservation legislation was passed. 　Baltimore has more public statues and monuments per capita than any other city in the country. 　Nearly one third of the city's buildings (over 65,000) are designated as historic in the National Register, which is more than any other U.S. city. 　Baltimore has 66 National Register Historic Districts and 33 local historic districts. 　The historical records of the government of Baltimore are located at the Baltimore City Archives.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife>Wildlife</a> </h2>
<p>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. 　Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. 　Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. 　Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. 　While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities. 　Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property, and quality of life. 　However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. 　This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature. 　Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. 　Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. 　This includes such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. 　Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment. 　Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth, and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event. 　According to CITES, it has been estimated that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.</p>
