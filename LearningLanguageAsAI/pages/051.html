<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter>Songwriter</a> </h2>
<p>A songwriter is a musician who professionally composes musical compositions or writes lyrics for songs, or both. 　The writer of the music for a song can be called a composer, although this term tends to be used mainly in the classical music genre and film scoring. 　A songwriter who mainly writes the lyrics for a song is referred to as a lyricist. 　The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that song writing is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. 　For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. 　Pop songs may be composed by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers. 　Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have external publishers. 　The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by university degrees, college diplomas and "rock schools". 　Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are significant for modern songwriters. 　Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules. 　Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record; legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. 　The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. 　This is governed by international copyright law. 　Songwriters can be employed in a variety of different ways. 　They may exclusively write lyrics or compose music alongside another artist, present songs to A&R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. 　Song pitching can be done on a songwriter's behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like RowFax, the MusicRow publication and SongQuarters. 　Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity. 　Staff writers do not necessarily get printed credit for their contributions to the song.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo>Tokyo</a> </h2>
<p>Tokyo (/ˈtoʊkioʊ/; Japanese: 東京, Tōkyō, [toːkʲoː] (listen)), officially the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to), is the capital and most populous city of Japan. 　Formerly known as Edo, its metropolitan area (13,452 square kilometers or 5,194 square miles) is the most populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million residents as of 2018[update]; the city proper has a population of 13.99 million people. 　Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. 　Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and is the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan. 　Originally a fishing village named Edo, the city became politically prominent in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. 　By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most populous cities in the world with a population of over one million people. 　Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, which was renamed "Tokyo" (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). 　Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II. 　Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion efforts, going on to lead the Japanese economic miracle. 　Since 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands. 　Tokyo is the second-largest urban economy worldwide by gross domestic product after New York City, and is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. 　It is also Japan's leading business hub as part of an industrial region that includes the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. 　As of 2021[update], Tokyo is home to 37 companies of the Fortune Global 500. 　In 2020, the city ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind only New York City, London, and Shanghai. 　Tokyo is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree, and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (located in Kasukabe, Saitama, a suburb of Tokyo). 　The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia. 　Recognized as one of the most livable cities in the world, Tokyo was tied fourth with Wellington in the 2021 Global Livability Ranking. 　The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics (postponed; held in 2021), and three summits of the G7 (in 1979, 1986, and 1993). 　Tokyo is an international research and development hub and is likewise represented by several major universities, most notably the University of Tokyo. 　Tokyo Station is the central hub for Japan's high-speed railway network, the Shinkansen; Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is also the world's busiest train station. 　Notable special wards of Tokyo include: Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief>Belief</a> </h2>
<p>A belief is a subjective attitude that something or proposition is true. 　In epistemology, philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to attitudes about the world which can be either true or false. 　To believe something is to take it to be true; for instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition "snow is white". 　However, holding a belief does not require active introspection. 　For example, few carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. 　Moreover, beliefs need not be occurrent (e.g. a person actively thinking "snow is white"), but can instead be dispositional (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert "snow is white"). 　There are various ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be (Jerry Fodor), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true (Roderick Chisholm), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone's actions (Daniel Dennett and Donald Davidson), or as mental states that fill a particular function (Hilary Putnam). 　Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including eliminativists about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our folk psychological concept of belief (Paul Churchland) and formal epistemologists who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief ("either we have a belief or we don't have a belief") with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence ("there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief"). 　Beliefs are the subject of various important philosophical debates. 　Notable examples include: "What is the rational way to revise one's beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?", "Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I'm holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H2O part of the content of that belief)?", "How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?", and "Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting>Hunting</a> </h2>
<p>Hunting is the human practice of seeking, pursuing, capturing, or killing wildlife or feral animals. 　The most common reasons for humans to hunt are to exploit the animal's body for food (i.e. meat) and useful animal products (fur/hide, bone/tusks, horn/antler, etc.), for recreation/taxidermy (see trophy hunting), although it may also be done for non-exploitative reasons such as removing predators dangerous to humans or domestic animals (e.g. wolf hunting), to eliminate pests and nuisance animals that damage crops/livestock/poultry or spread diseases (see varminting), for trade/tourism (see safari), or for ecological conservation against overpopulation and invasive species. 　Recreationally hunted species are generally referred to as the game, and are usually mammals and birds. 　A person participating in a hunt is a hunter or (less commonly) huntsman; a natural area used for hunting is called a game reserve; an experienced hunter who helps organize a hunt and/or manage the game reserve is known as a gamekeeper. 　Many non-human animals also hunt (see predation) as part of their feeding and parental behaviors, sometimes in quantities exceeding immediate dietary needs. 　The one that does the hunting is the predator, and the one being hunted is the prey. 　Hunting activities by humans arose in Homo erectus or earlier, in the order of millions of years ago. 　Hunting has become deeply embedded in various human cultures and was once an important part of the rural economies—classified by economists as part of primary production alongside forestry, agriculture and fishery. 　Modern regulations (see game law) distinguish lawful hunting activities from illegal poaching, which involves the unauthorized and unregulated killing, trapping or capture of animals. 　Apart from food provision, hunting can be a means of population control. 　Hunting advocates state that regulated hunting can be a necessary component of modern wildlife management, for example to help maintain a healthy proportion of animal populations within an environment's ecological carrying capacity when natural checks such as natural predators are absent or insufficient, or to provide funding for breeding programs and maintenance of natural reserves and conservation parks. 　However, excessive hunting has also heavily contributed to the endangerment, extirpation and extinction of many animals. 　Some animal rights and anti-hunting activists regard hunting as a cruel, perverse and unnecessary blood sport. 　Certain hunting practices, such as canned hunts and ludicrously paid/bribed trophy tours (especially to poor countries), are considered unethical and exploitative even by some hunters. 　Marine mammals such as whales and pinnipeds are also targets of hunting, both recreationally and commercially, often with heated controversies regarding the morality, ethics and legality of such practices. 　The pursuit, harvesting or catch and release of fish and aquatic cephalopods and crustaceans is called fishing, which however is widely accepted and not commonly categorised as a form of hunting, even though it essentially is. 　It is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in wildlife photography, birdwatching, or scientific-research activities which involve tranquilizing or tagging of animals, although green hunting is still called so. 　The practices of netting or trapping insects and other arthropods for trophy collection, or the foraging or gathering of plants and mushrooms, are also not regarded as hunting. 　Skillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word hunt to be used in the vernacular as a metaphor for searching and obtaining something, as in "treasure hunting", "bargain hunting", "hunting for votes" and even "hunting down" corruption and waste.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher>Christopher</a> </h2>
<p>Christopher is the English version of a Europe-wide name derived from the Greek name Χριστόφορος (Christophoros or Christoforos). 　The constituent parts are Χριστός (Christós), "Christ" or "Anointed", and φέρειν (phérein), "to bear"; hence the "Christ-bearer". 　As a given name, 'Christopher' has been in use since the 10th century. 　In English, Christopher may be abbreviated as "Chris", "Topher", and sometimes "Kit". 　It was frequently the most popular male first name in the United Kingdom, having been in the top twenty in England and Wales from the 1940s until 1995, although it has since dropped out of the top 100. 　The name is most common in England and not so common in Wales, Scotland, or Ireland.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault>Assault</a> </h2>
<p>An assault is the act of illegally committing physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action. 　It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in criminal prosecution, civil liability, or both. 　Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law. 　Traditionally, common law legal systems have separate definitions for assault and battery. 　When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. 　Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into a single crime called "assault and battery", which then became widely referred to as "assault". 　The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. 　The legal systems of civil law and Scots law have never distinguished assault from battery. 　Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. 　In the United States, an assault can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony. 　In England and Wales and Australia, it can be charged as either common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH) or grievous bodily harm (GBH). 　Canada also has a three-tier system: assault, assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault. 　Separate charges typically exist for sexual assaults, affray and assaulting a police officer. 　Assault may overlap with an attempted crime; for example an assault may be charged as an attempted murder if it was done with intent to kill.</p>

<p>A pen is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. 　Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity which had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell. 　Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized uses, such as in illustration and calligraphy. 　Reed pens, quill pens and dip pens, which were used for writing, have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or ceramic tip pens. 　Ruling pens, which were used for technical drawing and cartography, have been replaced by technical pens such as the Rapidograph. 　All of these modern pens contain internal ink reservoirs, such that they do not need to be dipped in ink while writing.</p>

<p>Surgery is a medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a person to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function, appearance, or to repair unwanted ruptured areas. 　The act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure, operation, or simply "surgery". 　In this context, the verb "operate" means to perform surgery. 　The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments or surgical nurse. 　The person or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. 　A surgeon is a person who practices surgery and a surgeon's assistant is a person who practices surgical assistance. 　A surgical team is made up of the surgeon, the surgeon's assistant, an anaesthetist, a circulating nurse and a surgical technologist. 　Surgery usually spans from minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. 　The term "surgery" can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone>Bone</a> </h2>
<p>A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. 　Bones protect the various other organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. 　Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have complex internal and external structures. 　They are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions. 　Bone tissue (osseous tissue), which is also called bone in the uncountable sense of that word, is hard tissue, a type of specialized connective tissue. 　It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. 　Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells. 　Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. 　Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. 　The mineralized matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. 　Bone tissue is mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. 　Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage. 　In the human body at birth, there are approximately 300 bones present; many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones. 　The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the stapes in the middle ear. 　The Greek word for bone is ὀστέον ("osteon"), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix—such as osteopathy. 　In anatomical terminology, including the Terminologia Anatomica international standard, the word for a bone is os (for example, os breve, os longum, os sesamoideum).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking>Drinking</a> </h2>
<p>Drinking is the act of ingesting water or other liquids into the body through the mouth, proboscis, or elsewhere. 　Humans drink by swallowing, completed by peristalsis in the esophagus. 　The physiological processes of drinking vary widely among other animals. 　Most animals drink water to maintain bodily hydration, although many can survive on the water gained from their food. 　Water is required for many physiological processes. 　Both inadequate and (less commonly) excessive water intake are associated with health problems.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popularity>Popularity</a> </h2>
<p>In sociology, popularity is how much a person, idea, place, item or other concept is either liked or accorded status by other people. 　Liking can be due to reciprocal liking, interpersonal attraction, and similar factors. 　Social status can be due to dominance, superiority, and similar factors. 　For example, a kind person may be considered likable and therefore more popular than another person, and a wealthy person may be considered superior and therefore more popular than another person. 　There are two primary types of interpersonal popularity: perceived and sociometric. 　Perceived popularity is measured by asking people who the most popular or socially important people in their social group are. 　Sociometric popularity is measured by objectively measuring the number of connections a person has to others in the group. 　A person can have high perceived popularity without having high sociometric popularity, and vice versa. 　According to psychologist Tessa Lansu at the Radboud University Nijmegen, "Popularity [has] to do with being the middle point of a group and having influence on it."</p>

<p>Eating (also known as consuming) is the ingestion of food, typically to provide a heterotrophic organism with energy and to allow for growth. 　Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive — carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus. 　Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies. 　For humans, eating is an activity of daily living. 　Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake. 　This may be a result of a lifestyle choice, due to hunger or famine, as part of a diet or as religious fasting.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(biology)>Flux (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>In general, flux in biology relates to movement of a substance between compartments. 　There are several cases where the concept of flux is important. 　The movement of molecules across a membrane: in this case, flux is defined by the rate of diffusion or transport of a substance across a permeable membrane. 　Except in the case of active transport, net flux is directly proportional to the concentration difference across the membrane, the surface area of the membrane, and the membrane permeability constant. 　In ecology, flux is often considered at the ecosystem level – for instance, accurate determination of carbon fluxes using techniques like eddy covariance (at a regional and global level) is essential for modeling the causes and consequences of global warming. 　Metabolic flux refers to the rate of flow of metabolites through a biochemical network, along a linear metabolic pathway, or through a single enzyme. 　A calculation may also be made of carbon flux or flux of other elemental components of biomolecules (e.g. nitrogen). 　The general unit of flux is chemical mass /time (e.g., micromole/minute; mg/kg/minute). 　Flux rates are dependent on a number of factors, including: enzyme concentration; the concentration of precursor, product, and intermediate metabolites; post-translational modification of enzymes; and the presence of metabolic activators or repressors. 　Metabolic flux in biologic systems can refer to biosynthesis rates of polymers or other macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, polynucleotides, or complex carbohydrates, as well as the flow of intermediary metabolites through pathways. 　Metabolic control analysis and flux balance analysis provide frameworks for understanding metabolic fluxes and their constraints.</p>

<p>Flux describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance. 　Flux is a concept in applied mathematics and vector calculus which has many applications to physics. 　For transport phenomena, flux is a vector quantity, describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property. 　In vector calculus flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry>Chemistry</a> </h2>
<p>Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. 　It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. 　Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds. 　In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. 　It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. 　For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming>Swimming</a> </h2>
<p>Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. 　Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. 　Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response. 　Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum. 　As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics. 　Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes in order to propel the body forward. 　While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest out of four primary strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as for training. 　There are various risks present during swimming, mainly due to it taking place in water. 　Swimmers are at risk of incapacitation due to panic and exhaustion, which may cause death due to drowning. 　Other dangers include getting an infection or contact with hostile aquatic fauna. 　To minimize these risks, most facilities employ a lifeguard to look for signs of distress. 　Swimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the culture of the area, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire. 　In addition to this, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec>Quebec</a> </h2>
<p>Quebec (/k(w)ɪˈbɛk/ k(w)ih-BEK; French: Québec [kebɛk] (listen)) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. 　It is the largest province by area and the second-largest by population. 　Much of the population lives in urban areas along the St. Lawrence River, between the most populous city, Montreal, and the provincial capital, Quebec City. 　Quebec is the home of the Québécois nation. 　Located in Central Canada, the province shares land borders with Ontario to the west, Newfoundland and Labrador to the northeast, New Brunswick to the southeast, and a coastal border with Nunavut; in the south it borders Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York in the United States. 　Between 1534 and 1763, Quebec was called Canada and was the most developed colony in New France. 　Following the Seven Years' War, Quebec became a British colony: first as the Province of Quebec (1763–1791), then Lower Canada (1791–1841), and lastly Canada East (1841–1867), as a result of the Lower Canada Rebellion. 　It was confederated with Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in 1867, beginning the Dominion of Canada. 　Until the early 1960s, the Catholic Church played a large role in the social and cultural institutions in Quebec. 　However, the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s to 1980s increased the role of the Government of Quebec in l'État québécois (the state of Quebec). 　The Government of Quebec functions within the context of a Westminster system and is both a liberal democracy and a constitutional monarchy. 　The Premier of Quebec, presently François Legault, acts as head of government. 　Québécois political culture mostly differs on a nationalist-vs-federalist continuum, rather than a left-vs-right continuum. 　Independence debates have played a large role in politics. 　Quebec society's cohesion and specificity is based on three of its unique statutory documents: the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, the Charter of the French Language, and the Civil Code of Quebec. 　Furthermore, unlike elsewhere in Canada, law in Quebec is mixed: private law is exercised under a civil-law system, while public law is exercised under a common-law system. 　Quebec's official language is French; Québécois French is the regional variety. 　The economy of Quebec is mainly supported by its large service sector and varied industrial sector. 　For exports, it leans on the key industries of aeronautics, hydroelectricity, mining, pharmaceuticals, aluminum, wood, and paper. 　Quebec is well known for producing maple syrup, for its comedy, and for making hockey one of the most popular sports in Canada. 　It is also renowned for its culture; the province produces literature, music, films, TV shows, festivals, folklore, and more.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing>Sharing</a> </h2>
<p>Sharing is the joint use of a resource or space. 　It is also the process of dividing and distributing. 　In its narrow sense, it refers to joint or alternating use of inherently finite goods, such as a common pasture or a shared residence. 　Still more loosely, "sharing" can actually mean giving something as an outright gift: for example, to "share" one's food really means to give some of it as a gift. 　Sharing is a basic component of human interaction, and is responsible for strengthening social ties and ensuring a person’s well-being. 　Apart from obvious instances, which can be observed in human activity, many examples can be found in nature. 　When an organism takes in nutrition or oxygen, for instance, its internal organs are designed to divide and distribute the energy taken in, to supply parts of its body that need it. 　Flowers divide and distribute their seeds. 　In a broader sense, it can also include free granting of use rights to goods that can be treated as nonrival goods, such as information.</p>
