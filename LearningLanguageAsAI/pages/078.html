<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator>Elevator</a> </h2>
<p>An elevator or lift is a machine that vertically transports people or freight between levels. 　They are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a hoist, although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a jack. 　In agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos. 　Several types exist, such as the chain and bucket elevator, grain auger screw conveyor using the principle of Archimedes' screw, or the chain and paddles or forks of hay elevators. 　Languages other than English, such as Japanese, may refer to elevators by loanwords based on either elevator or lift. 　Due to wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps are not possible. 　High-speed elevators are elevators that move faster than regular elevators and are common in skyscrapers and towers. 　Some elevators can also travel horizontally in addition to the usual vertical motion.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses>Moses</a> </h2>
<p>Moses (/ˈmoʊzɪz, -zɪs/) is considered the most important prophet in Judaism and one of the most important prophets in Christianity, Islam, the Druze faith, the Baháʼí Faith and other Abrahamic religions. 　According to both the Bible and the Quran, Moses was the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver to whom the authorship, or "acquisition from heaven", of the Torah (the first five books of the Bible) is attributed. 　According to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in population and, as a result, the Egyptian Pharaoh worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. 　Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. 　Through Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. 　After killing an Egyptian slave-master who was beating a Hebrew, Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered the Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb, which he regarded as the Mountain of God. 　God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. 　Moses said that he could not speak eloquently, so God allowed Aaron, his elder brother, to become his spokesperson. 　After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. 　After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died on Mount Nebo at the age of 120, within sight of the Promised Land. 　Generally, scholars see Moses as a legendary figure, whilst retaining the possibility that Moses or a Moses-like figure existed in the 13th century BCE. 　Rabbinical Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 BCE; Jerome suggested 1592 BCE, and James Ussher suggested 1571 BCE as his birth year.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference>Inference</a> </h2>
<p>Inferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; etymologically, the word infer means to "carry forward". 　Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction, a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BCE). 　Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. 　Induction is inference from particular evidence to a universal conclusion. 　A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by Charles Sanders Peirce, contradistinguishing abduction from induction. 　Various fields study how inference is done in practice. 　Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the fields of logic, argumentation studies, and cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. 　Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. 　This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. 　Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken>Chicken</a> </h2>
<p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. 　Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. 　A male that has been castrated is a capon. 　An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. 　Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. 　Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. 　The chicken domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its eggs are Layers. 　Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update], up from more than 19 billion in 2011. 　There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. 　There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.　[citation needed] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. 　From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. 　They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III. 　They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecture>Lecture</a> </h2>
<p>A lecture (from Latin lēctūra “reading” ) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. 　Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. 　A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture. 　Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content. 　Though lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses. 　Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning. 　Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. 　Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study. 　Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. 　Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on "keynote addresses", i.e., lectures. 　The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. 　Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. 　Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. 　Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. 　Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome>Syndrome</a> </h2>
<p>A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms which are correlated with each other and often associated with a particular disease or disorder. 　The word derives from the Greek σύνδρομον, meaning "concurrence".　: 1818  When a syndrome is paired with a definite cause this becomes a disease. 　In some instances, a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words syndrome, disease, and disorder end up being used interchangeably for them. 　This substitution of terminology often confuses the reality and meaning of medical diagnoses. 　This is especially true of inherited syndromes. 　About one third of all phenotypes that are listed in OMIM are described as dysmorphic, which usually refers to the facial gestalt. 　For example, Down syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen–Tawil syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the syndrome nomenclature. 　In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. 　For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms. 　If an underlying genetic cause is suspected but not known, a condition may be referred to as a genetic association (often just "association" in context). 　By definition, an association indicates that the collection of signs and symptoms occurs in combination more frequently than would be likely by chance alone.　: 167  Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians that discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture. 　Such eponymous syndrome names are examples of medical eponyms. 　Recently, there has been a shift towards naming conditions descriptively (by symptoms or underlying cause) rather than eponymously, but the eponymous syndrome names often persist in common usage. 　The defining of syndromes has sometimes been termed syndromology, but it is usually not a separate discipline from nosology and differential diagnosis generally, which inherently involve pattern recognition (both sentient and automated) and differentiation among overlapping sets of signs and symptoms. 　Teratology (dysmorphology) by its nature involves the defining of congenital syndromes that may include birth defects (pathoanatomy), dysmetabolism (pathophysiology), and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi>Rabbi</a> </h2>
<p>A rabbi (/ˈræbaɪ/) is a spiritual leader or religious teacher in Judaism. 　One becomes a rabbi by being ordained by another rabbi – known as semikha – following a course of study of Jewish history and texts such as the Talmud. 　The basic form of the rabbi developed in the Pharisaic (167 BCE–73 CE) and Talmudic (70–640 CE) eras, when learned teachers assembled to codify Judaism's written and oral laws. 　The title "rabbi" was first used in the first century CE. 　In more recent centuries, the duties of a rabbi became increasingly influenced by the duties of the Protestant Christian minister, hence the title "pulpit rabbis", and in 19th-century Germany and the United States rabbinic activities including sermons, pastoral counseling, and representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance. 　Within the various Jewish denominations, there are different requirements for rabbinic ordination, and differences in opinion regarding who is recognized as a rabbi. 　For example, only a minority of Orthodox Jewish communities accept the ordination of women rabbis. 　Non-Orthodox movements have chosen to do so for what they view as halakhic reasons (Conservative Judaism) as well as ethical reasons (Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland>Holland</a> </h2>
<p>Holland is a geographical region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. 　From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland proper was a unified political region within the Holy Roman Empire as a county ruled by the counts of Holland. 　By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent Dutch Republic. 　The area of the former County of Holland roughly coincides with the two current Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland into which it was divided, and which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the capital city (Amsterdam), the home of Europe's largest port (Rotterdam), and the seat of government (The Hague). 　Holland has a population of 6,583,534 as of November 2019, and a population density of 1203/km2. 　The name Holland has frequently been used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. 　This casual usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and is even employed by many Dutch themselves. 　However, some in the Netherlands (particularly those from regions outside Holland or the west) find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country. 　In January 2020, the Netherlands officially dropped its support of the word Holland for the whole country, which included a logo redesign that changed "Holland" to "NL".</p>

<p>Look up generalization in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A generalization is a form of abstraction whereby common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims. 　Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). 　As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences (particularly in logic, mathematics and science), where the process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation. 　Generalization can also be used to refer to the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole. 　The parts, which might be unrelated when left on their own, may be brought together as a group, hence belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them. 　However, the parts cannot be generalized into a whole—until a common relation is established among all parts. 　This does not mean that the parts are unrelated, only that no common relation has been established yet for the generalization. 　The concept of generalization has broad application in many connected disciplines, and might sometimes have a more specific meaning in a specialized context (e.g. generalization in psychology, generalization in learning). 　In general, given two related concepts A and B, A is a "generalization" of B (equiv., B is a special case of A) if and only if both of the following hold: Every instance of concept B is also an instance of concept A. There are instances of concept A which are not instances of concept B. For example, the concept animal is a generalization of the concept bird, since every bird is an animal, but not all animals are birds (dogs, for instance). 　For more, see Specialisation (biology).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington>Wellington</a> </h2>
<p>Wellington (Māori: Te Whanganui-a-Tara [tɛ ˈɸaŋanʉi a taɾa] or Pōneke [pɔːnɛkɛ]) is the capital city of New Zealand. 　It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Remutaka Range. 　Wellington is the third-largest city in New Zealand by metro area, and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region. 　It is the world's southernmost capital of a sovereign state. 　Wellington features a temperate maritime climate, and is the world's windiest city by average wind speed. 　Legends recount that Kupe discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century, with initial settlement by Māori iwi such as Rangitāne and Muaūpoko. 　The disruptions of the Musket Wars led to them being overwhelmed by northern iwi such as Te Āti Awa by the early 19th century. 　Wellington's current form was originally designed by Captain William Mein Smith, the first Surveyor General for Edward Wakefield's New Zealand Company, in 1840. 　The Wellington urban area, which only includes urbanised areas within Wellington City, has a population of 212,000 as of June 2022. 　The wider Wellington metropolitan area, including the cities of Lower Hutt, Porirua and Upper Hutt, has a population of 434,900 as of June 2022. 　The city has served as New Zealand's capital since 1865, a status that is not defined in legislation, but established by convention; the New Zealand Government and Parliament, the Supreme Court and most of the public service are based in the city. 　Wellington's economy is primarily service-based, with an emphasis on finance, business services, government, and the film industry. 　It is the centre of New Zealand's film and special effects industries, and increasingly a hub for information technology and innovation, with two public research universities. 　Wellington is one of New Zealand's chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. 　The city is chiefly served by Wellington International Airport in Rongotai, the country's second-busiest airport. 　Wellington's transport network includes train and bus lines which reach as far as the Kapiti Coast and the Wairarapa, and ferries connect the city to the South Island. 　Often referred to as New Zealand's cultural capital, the culture of Wellington is a diverse and often youth-driven one which has wielded influence across Oceania. 　One of the world's most liveable cities, the 2021 Global Livability Ranking tied Wellington with Tokyo as fourth in the world. 　From 2017 to 2018, Deutsche Bank ranked it first in the world for both livability and non-pollution. 　Cultural precincts such as Cuba Street and Newtown are renowned for creative innovation, "op shops", historic character, and food. 　Wellington is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region, being ranked 35th in the world by the Global Financial Centres Index for 2021. 　The global city has grown from a bustling Māori settlement, to a colonial outpost, and from there to an Australasian capital that has experienced a "remarkable creative resurgence".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra>Ultra</a> </h2>
<p>Ultra was the designation adopted by British military intelligence in June 1941 for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted enemy radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. 　Ultra eventually became the standard designation among the western Allies for all such intelligence. 　The name arose because the intelligence obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British security classification then used (Most Secret) and so was regarded as being Ultra Secret. 　Several other cryptonyms had been used for such intelligence. 　The code name Boniface was used as a cover name for Ultra. 　In order to ensure that the successful code-breaking did not become apparent to the Germans, British intelligence created a fictional MI6 master spy, Boniface, who controlled a fictional series of agents throughout Germany. 　Information obtained through code-breaking was often attributed to the human intelligence from the Boniface network. 　The U.S. used the codename Magic for its decrypts from Japanese sources, including the "Purple" cipher. 　Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine. 　Used properly, the German military Enigma would have been virtually unbreakable; in practice, shortcomings in operation allowed it to be broken. 　The term "Ultra" has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts". 　However, Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machines that were used by the German High Command, and the Hagelin machine. 　Many observers, at the time and later, regarded Ultra as immensely valuable to the Allies. 　Winston Churchill was reported to have told King George VI, when presenting to him Stewart Menzies (head of the Secret Intelligence Service and the person who controlled distribution of Ultra decrypts to the government): "It is thanks to the secret weapon of General Menzies, put into use on all the fronts, that we won the war!" 　F. W. Winterbotham quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end describing Ultra as having been "decisive" to Allied victory. 　Sir Harry Hinsley, Bletchley Park veteran and official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment of Ultra, saying that while the Allies would have won the war without it, "the war would have been something like two years longer, perhaps three years longer, possibly four years longer than it was." 　However, Hinsley and others have emphasized the difficulties of counterfactual history in attempting such conclusions, and some historians, such as Keegan, have said the shortening might have been as little as the three months it took the United States to deploy the atomic bomb. 　The existence of Ultra was kept secret for many years after the war. 　Since the Ultra story was widely disseminated by Winterbotham in 1974, historians have altered the historiography of World War II. 　For example, Andrew Roberts, writing in the 21st century, states, "Because he had the invaluable advantage of being able to read Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Enigma communications, General Bernard Montgomery knew how short the Germans were of men, ammunition, food and above all fuel. When he put Rommel's picture up in his caravan he wanted to be seen to be almost reading his opponent's mind. In fact he was reading his mail." 　Over time, Ultra has become embedded in the public consciousness and Bletchley Park has become a significant visitor attraction. 　As stated by historian Thomas Haigh, "The British code-breaking effort of the Second World War, formerly secret, is now one of the most celebrated aspects of modern British history, an inspiring story in which a free society mobilized its intellectual resources against a terrible enemy."</p>

<p>A curse (also called an imprecation, malediction, execration, malison, anathema, or commination) is any expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to one or more persons, a place, or an object. 　In particular, "curse" may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power, such as a god or gods, a spirit, or a natural force, or else as a kind of spell by magic (usually black magic) or witchcraft; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a hex or a jinx. 　In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying ritual) is considered to have some causative force in the result. 　To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called "removal" or "breaking", as the spell has to be dispelled, and often requires elaborate rituals or prayers.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial>Burial</a> </h2>
<p>Burial, also known as interment or inhumation, is a method of final disposition whereby a dead body is placed into the ground, sometimes with objects. 　This is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. 　A funeral is a ceremony that accompanies the final disposition. 　Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species.　[citation needed] Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. 　It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life. 　Methods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called "green burial"); embalming or mummification; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds, coffins, grave liners, and burial vaults, all of which can retard decomposition of the body. 　Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb. 　Depending on the culture, the way the body is positioned may have great significance. 　The location of the burial may be determined by taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices. 　Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others "banish" them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas. 　Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries. 　Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones, which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased. 　However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons. 　Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once. 　Alternatives to burial include cremation (and subsequent interment), burial at sea and cryopreservation. 　Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals. 　Humans are not the only species to bury their dead; the practice has been observed in chimpanzees, elephants, and possibly dogs.</p>
