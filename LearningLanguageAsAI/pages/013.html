<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length>Length</a> </h2>
<p>Length is a measure of distance. 　In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. 　In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. 　In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre. 　Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. 　However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in. 　Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. 　Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. 　Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. 　Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object. 　Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason>Reason</a> </h2>
<p>Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. 　It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. 　Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality. 　Reasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. 　The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. 　Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. 　Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. 　In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. 　For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks. 　Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. 　For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. 　Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination. 　In contrast to the use of "reason" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. 　Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals. 　Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. 　For example, when evaluating a moral decision, "morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does." 　Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. 　The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. 　Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic>Republic</a> </h2>
<p>A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a "state in which power rests with the people or their representatives; specifically a state without a monarchy" and also a "government, or system of government, of such a state." 　Previously, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, the term was used to imply a state with a democratic or representative constitution (constitutional republic), but more recently it has also been used of autocratic or dictatorial states not ruled by a monarch. 　It is now chiefly used to denote any non-monarchical state headed by an elected or appointed president. 　As of 2017[update], 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word "republic" as part of their official names. 　Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word "republic" used in the names of all states with elected governments. 　The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means "public thing", "public matter", or "public affair" and was used to refer to the state as a whole. 　The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BCE. 　This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority. 　Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. 　For instance, the United States Constitution "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government". 　Another example was the Soviet Union, described by its authoritarian and extremely centralised government as being a federation of voluntarily united "Soviet socialist republics" with equal rights and an ostensibly high degree of internal autonomy. 　The Russian Federation is similarly a state that is composed partly of several "republics".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing>Writing</a> </h2>
<p>Writing is a neuropsychological activity involving cognitive and physical processes and the use of writing systems to structure and translate human thoughts into persistent representations of human language. 　A system of writing relies on many of the same semantic structures as the language it represents, such as lexicon and syntax, with the added dependency of a system of symbols representing that language's phonology and morphology. 　Nevertheless, written language may take on characteristics distinctive from any available in spoken language. 　The outcome of this activity, also called "writing", and sometimes a "text", is a series of physically inscribed, mechanically transferred, or digitally represented linguistic symbols. 　The interpreter or activator of a text is called a "reader". 　Writing systems do not themselves constitute languages (with the debatable exception of computer languages); they are a means of rendering language into a form that can be reconstructed by other humans separated by time and/or space. 　While not all languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend capacities of spoken language by creating durable forms of language that can be transmitted across space (e.g. written correspondence) and stored over time (e.g. libraries or other public records). 　Writing can also have knowledge-transforming effects, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, elaborate, reconsider, and revise.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge>Bridge</a> </h2>
<p>A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath. 　It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross. 　There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations. 　Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it. 　The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones. 　The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland. 　The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition>Competition</a> </h2>
<p>Competition is a rivalry where two or more parties strive for a common goal which cannot be shared: where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a zero-sum game). 　Competition can arise between entities such as organisms, individuals, economic and social groups, etc. 　The rivalry can be over attainment of any exclusive goal, including recognition: Competition occurs in nature, between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment. 　Animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources. 　Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige, and fame when in a static, repetitive, or unchanging environment. 　Competition is a major tenet of market economies and business, often associated with business competition as companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. 　Competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop. 　Competition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation, however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm. 　In economies, as the philosopher R. G. Collingwood argued "the presence of these two opposites together is essential to an economic system. The parties to an economic action co-operate in competing, like two chess players". 　Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as game theory. 　Competition has been studied in several fields, including psychology, sociology and anthropology. 　Social psychologists, for instance, study the nature of competition. 　They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. 　They also study group dynamics, to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. 　Sociologists, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. 　Additionally, anthropologists study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. 　They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various cultural settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(biology)>Competition (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>Competition is an interaction between organisms or species in which both require a resource that is in limited supply (such as food, water, or territory). 　Competition lowers the fitness of both organisms involved since the presence of one of the organisms always reduces the amount of the resource available to the other. 　In the study of community ecology, competition within and between members of a species is an important biological interaction. 　Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure, species diversity, and population dynamics (shifts in a population over time). 　There are three major mechanisms of competition: interference, exploitation, and apparent competition (in order from most direct to least direct). 　Interference and exploitation competition can be classed as "real" forms of competition, while apparent competition is not, as organisms do not share a resource, but instead share a predator. 　Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition. 　According to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete for resources must either adapt or die out, although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. 　According to evolutionary theory, competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection. 　More recently, however, researchers have suggested that evolutionary biodiversity for vertebrates has been driven not by competition between organisms, but by these animals adapting to colonize empty livable space; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan>Japan</a> </h2>
<p>Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon, and formally 日本国, Nihonkoku) is an island country in East Asia. 　It is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. 　Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu (the "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. 　Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto. 　Japan is the eleventh most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. 　About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of almost 125 million on narrow coastal plains. 　Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. 　The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.2 million residents. 　Japan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first written mention of the archipelago appears in a Chinese chronicle (the Book of Han) finished in the 2nd century AD. 　Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. 　Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō) and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). 　After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. 　In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. 　In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. 　Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. 　After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution and began a military alliance with the United States. 　Under the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. 　Japan is a developed country and a great power. 　It is a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, G20, OECD, and the Group of Seven. 　Its economy is the world's third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP, with its per capita income ranking at 36th highest in the world. 　Although Japan has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that rank as one of the world's strongest militaries. 　After World War II, Japan experienced record growth in an economic miracle, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1972 but has stagnated since 1995 in what is referred to as the Lost Decades. 　Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a population decline. 　A global leader in the automotive, robotics and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology. 　The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent manga, anime and video game industries.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)>Distribution (pharmacology)</a> </h2>
<p>Distribution in pharmacology is a branch of pharmacokinetics which describes the reversible transfer of a drug from one location to another within the body. 　Once a drug enters into systemic circulation by absorption or direct administration, it must be distributed into interstitial and intracellular fluids. 　Each organ or tissue can receive different doses of the drug and the drug can remain in the different organs or tissues for a varying amount of time. 　The distribution of a drug between tissues is dependent on vascular permeability, regional blood flow, cardiac output and perfusion rate of the tissue and the ability of the drug to bind tissue and plasma proteins and its lipid solubility. 　pH partition plays a major role as well. 　The drug is easily distributed in highly perfused organs such as the liver, heart and kidney. 　It is distributed in small quantities through less perfused tissues like muscle, fat and peripheral organs. 　The drug can be moved from the plasma to the tissue until the equilibrium is established (for unbound drug present in plasma). 　The concept of compartmentalization of an organism must be considered when discussing a drug’s distribution. 　This concept is used in pharmacokinetic modelling.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential>Potential</a> </h2>
<p>Potential generally refers to a currently unrealized ability. 　The term is used in a wide variety of fields, from physics to the social sciences to indicate things that are in a state where they are able to change in ways ranging from the simple release of energy by objects to the realization of abilities in people. 　The philosopher Aristotle incorporated this concept into his theory of potentiality and actuality, a pair of closely connected principles which he used to analyze motion, causality, ethics, and physiology in his Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, and De Anima, which is about the human psyche. 　That which is potential can theoretically be made actual by taking the right action; for example, a boulder on the edge of a cliff has potential to fall that could be actualized by pushing it over the edge. 　Several languages have a potential mood, a grammatical construction that indicates that something is potential. 　These include Finnish, Japanese, and Sanskrit. 　In physics, a potential may refer to the scalar potential or to the vector potential. 　In either case, it is a field defined in space, from which many important physical properties may be derived. 　Leading examples are the gravitational potential and the electric potential, from which the motion of gravitating or electrically charged bodies may be obtained. 　Specific forces have associated potentials, including the Coulomb potential, the van der Waals potential, the Lennard-Jones potential and the Yukawa potential. 　In electrochemistry there are Galvani potential, Volta potential, electrode potential, and standard electrode potential. 　In the thermodynamics, the term potential often refers to thermodynamic potential.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade>Trade</a> </h2>
<p>Trade involves the transfer of goods and services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. 　Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market. 　An early form of trade, barter, saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services, i.e. trading things without the use of money. 　Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. 　As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. 　The invention of money (and letter of credit, paper money, and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade. 　Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade. 　In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labour, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs. 　Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity—including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere. 　For example: different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. 　In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations. 　Different types of traders may specialize in trading different kinds of goods; for example, the spice trade and grain trade have both historically been important in the development of a global, international economy. 　Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. 　Wholesale trade is traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services. 　Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. 　Trade openness increased again during the 1920s but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. 　Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). 　Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(archaeology)>Cut (archaeology)</a> </h2>
<p>In archaeology and archaeological stratification, a cut or truncation is a context that represents a moment in time when other archaeological deposits were removed for the creation of some feature, such as a ditch or pit. 　In layman's terms, a cut can be thought of as a hole that was dug in the past, though cut also applies to other parts of the archaeological record such as horizontal truncations like terraced ground. 　A cut context is sometimes referred to as a "negative context", as opposed to a "positive context". 　The term denotes that a cut has removed material from the archaeological record or natural[clarification needed] at the time of its creation, as opposed to a positive context, which adds material to the archaeological record. 　A cut has zero thickness and no material properties of its own and is defined by the limits of other contexts. 　Cuts are seen in the record by virtue of the difference between the material it was cut through and the material that back-fills it. 　This difference is seen as an "edge" by the archaeologists on site. 　This is shown in the picture (Fig. 1), where a half sectioned Saxon pit has had half its backfill removed and we can clearly see a difference between the ground the pit was cut into, and the material originally filling the pit. 　Sometimes these differences are not clear and an archaeologist must rely on experience and insight to discover cuts.</p>

<p>A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. 　Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile. 　Among humans, a smile expresses delight, sociability, happiness, joy, or amusement. 　It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of anxiety known as a grimace. 　Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world, there are large differences among different cultures, religions, and societies, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense>Sense</a> </h2>
<p>A sense is a biological system used by an organism for sensation, the process of gathering information about the world through the detection of stimuli. 　(For example, in the human body, the brain which is part of the central nervous system receives signals from the senses which continuously receive information from the environment, interprets these signals, and causes the body to respond, either chemically or physically.) 　Although traditionally five human senses were identified as such (namely sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing), it is now recognized that there are many more. 　Senses used by non-human organisms are even greater in variety and number. 　During sensation, sense organs collect various stimuli (such as a sound or smell) for transduction, meaning transformation into a form that can be understood by the brain. 　Sensation and perception are fundamental to nearly every aspect of an organism's cognition, behavior and thought. 　In organisms, a sensory organ consists of a group of interrelated sensory cells that respond to a specific type of physical stimulus. 　Via cranial and spinal nerves (nerves of the Central and Peripheral nervous systems that relay sensory information to and from the brain and body), the different types of sensory receptor cells (such as mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors) in sensory organs transduct sensory information from these organs towards the central nervous system, finally arriving at the sensory cortices in the brain, where sensory signals are processed and interpreted (perceived). 　Sensory systems, or senses, are often divided into external (exteroception) and internal (interoception) sensory systems. 　Human external senses are based on the sensory organs of the eyes, ears, skin, nose, and mouth. 　Internal sensation detects stimuli from internal organs and tissues. 　Internal senses possessed by humans include the vestibular system (sense of balance) sensed by the inner ear, as well as others such as spatial orientation, proprioception (body position) and nociception (pain). 　Further internal senses lead to signals such as hunger, thirst, suffocation, and nausea, or different involuntary behaviors, such as vomiting. 　Some animals are able to detect electrical and magnetic fields, air moisture, or polarized light, while others sense and perceive through alternative systems, such as echolocation. 　Sensory modalities or sub modalities are different ways sensory information is encoded or transduced. 　Multimodality integrates different senses into one unified perceptual experience. 　For example, information from one sense has the potential to influence how information from another is perceived. 　Sensation and perception are studied by a variety of related fields, most notably psychophysics, neurobiology, cognitive psychology, and cognitive science.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast>Coast</a> </h2>
<p>The coast, also known as the coastline or seashore, is defined as the area where land meets the ocean, or as a line that forms the boundary between the land and the coastline. 　The Earth has around 620,000 kilometres (390,000 mi) of coastline. 　Coasts are important zones in natural ecosystems, often home to a wide range of biodiversity. 　On land, they harbor important ecosystems such as freshwater or estuarine wetlands, which are important for bird populations and other terrestrial animals. 　In wave-protected areas they harbor saltmarshes, mangroves or seagrasses, all of which can provide nursery habitat for finfish, shellfish, and other aquatic species. 　Rocky shores are usually found along exposed coasts and provide habitat for a wide range of sessile animals (e.g. mussels, starfish, barnacles) and various kinds of seaweeds. 　Along tropical coasts with clear, nutrient-poor water, coral reefs can often be found between depths of 1–50 meters (3.3–164.0 feet). 　According to a United Nations atlas, 44% of all people live within 5 km (3.3mi) of the sea. 　Because of their importance in society and high concentration of population, the coast is important for major parts of the global food and economic system, and they provide many ecosystem services to humankind. 　For example, important human activities happen in port cities. 　Coastal fisheries (commercial, recreational, and subsistence) and aquaculture are major economic activities and create jobs, livelihoods, and protein for the majority of coastal human populations. 　Other coastal spaces like beaches and seaside resorts generate large revenues through tourism. 　Marine coastal ecosystems can also provide protection against sea level rise and tsunamis. 　In many countries, mangroves are the primary source of wood for fuel (e.g. charcoal) and building material. 　Coastal ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses have a much higher capacity for carbon sequestration than many terrestrial ecosystems, and as such can play a critical role in the near-future to help mitigate climate change effects by uptake of atmospheric anthropogenic carbon dioxide. 　However, the economic importance of coasts makes many of these communities vulnerable to climate change, which causes increases in extreme weather and sea level rise, and related issues such as coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion and coastal flooding. 　Other coastal issues, such as marine pollution, marine debris, coastal development, and marine ecosystem destruction, further complicate the human uses of the coast and threaten coastal ecosystems. 　The interactive effects of climate change, habitat destruction, overfishing and water pollution (especially eutrophication) have led to the demise of coastal ecosystem around the globe. 　This has resulted in population collapse of fisheries stocks, loss of biodiversity, increased invasion of alien species, and loss of healthy habitats. 　International attention to these issues has been captured in Sustainable Development Goal 14 "Life Below Water" which sets goals for international policy focused on preserving marine coastal ecosystems and supporting more sustainable economic practices for coastal communities. 　Likewise, the United Nations has declared 2021-2030 the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, but restoration of coastal ecosystems has received insufficient attention. 　Because coasts are constantly changing, a coastline's exact perimeter cannot be determined; this measurement challenge is called the coastline paradox. 　The term coastal zone is used to refer to a region where interactions of sea and land processes occur. 　Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region located on a coastline (e.g., New Zealand's West Coast, or the East, West, and Gulf Coast of the United States.) Coasts with a narrow continental shelf that are close to the open ocean are called pelagic coast, while other coasts are more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay. 　A shore, on the other hand, may refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water, including oceans (sea shore) and lakes (lake shore).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir>Sir</a> </h2>
<p>Sir is a formal honorific address in English for men, derived from Sire in the High Middle Ages. 　Both are derived from the old French "Sieur" (Lord), brought to England by the French-speaking Normans, and which now exist in French only as part of "Monsieur", with the equivalent "My Lord" in English. 　Traditionally, as governed by law and custom, Sir is used for men titled as knights, often as members of orders of chivalry, as well as later applied to baronets and other offices. 　As the female equivalent for knighthood is damehood, the suo jure female equivalent term is typically Dame. 　The wife of a knight or baronet tends to be addressed as Lady, although a few exceptions and interchanges of these uses exist. 　Additionally, since the late modern period, Sir has been used as a respectful way to address a man of superior social status or military rank. 　Equivalent terms of address for women are Madam (shortened to Ma'am), in addition to social honorifics such as Mrs, Ms or Miss.</p>
