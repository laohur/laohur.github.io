<p>In geology, a complex is a lithodemic unit consisting of two or more lithodemes of more than one genetic class (metamorphic, igneous or sedimentary). 　The law of superposition is inapplicable to intrusive, highly deformed, or metamorphic bodies of rock lacking discernible stratification. 　Such bodies of rock are described as lithodemic and are determined and delimited based on rock characteristics. 　The 1983 North American Stratigraphic Code adopted the formal term lithodeme, which is comparable to a formation. 　A lithodeme is the fundamental unit and should possess distinctive and consistent lithological features, comprising a single rock type or a mixture of two or more types that distinguishes the unit from those around it. 　A complex is a group of two or more lithodemes of more than one genetic classes. 　It differs from a suite, which is a group of two or more lithodemes of the same genetic class.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size>Size</a> </h2>
<p>Size in general is the magnitude or dimensions of a thing. 　More specifically, geometrical size (or spatial size) can refer to linear dimensions (length, width, height, diameter, perimeter), area, or volume. 　Size can also be measured in terms of mass, especially when assuming a density range. 　In mathematical terms, "size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter". 　Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement. 　Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale, such as meters or inches. 　The sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of anthropometry), which include measures such as human height and human body weight. 　These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes. 　The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size bias, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank>Bank</a> </h2>
<p>A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. 　Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets. 　Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. 　Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. 　In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords. 　Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. 　In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties – notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds – have played a central role over many centuries. 　The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles>Charles</a> </h2>
<p>Charles is a masculine given name predominantly found in English and French speaking countries. 　It is from the French form Charles of the Proto-Germanic name ᚲᚨᚱᛁᛚᚨᛉ (in runic alphabet) or *karilaz (in Latin alphabet), whose meaning was "free man". 　The Old English descendant of this word was Ċearl or Ċeorl, as the name of King Cearl of Mercia, that disappeared after the Norman conquest of England. 　The name was notably borne by Charlemagne (Charles the Great), and was at the time Latinized as Karolus (as in Vita Karoli Magni), later also as Carolus. 　Some Germanic languages, for example Dutch and German, have retained the word in two separate senses. 　In the particular case of Dutch, Karel refers to the given name, whereas the noun kerel means "a bloke, fellow, man".</p>

<p>Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way. 　The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,: 117  including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. 　Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life. 　Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. 　The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age. 　The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. 　More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy. 　While technology contributes to economic development and improve human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution or resource depletion, or may cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. 　As a result, there are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate potential downsides.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(topology)>Base (topology)</a> </h2>
<p>In mathematics, a base (or basis) for the topology τ of a topological space (X, τ) is a family B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} of open subsets of X such that every open set of the topology is equal to the union of some sub-family of B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} . 　For example, the set of all open intervals in the real number line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a basis for the Euclidean topology on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } because every open interval is an open set, and also every open subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } can be written as a union of some family of open intervals. 　Bases are ubiquitous throughout topology. 　The sets in a base for a topology, which are called basic open sets, are often easier to describe and use than arbitrary open sets. 　Many important topological definitions such as continuity and convergence can be checked using only basic open sets instead of arbitrary open sets. 　Some topologies have a base of open sets with specific useful properties that may make checking such topological definitions easier. 　Not all families of subsets of a set X {\displaystyle X} form a base for a topology on X {\displaystyle X} . 　Under some conditions detailed below, a family of subsets will form a base for a (unique) topology on X {\displaystyle X} , obtained by taking all possible unions of subfamilies. 　Such families of sets are very frequently used to define topologies. 　A weaker notion related to bases is that of a subbase for a topology. 　Bases for topologies are also closely related to neighborhood bases.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence>Evidence</a> </h2>
<p>Evidence for a proposition is what supports this proposition. 　It is usually understood as an indication that the supported proposition is true. 　What role evidence plays and how it is conceived varies from field to field. 　In epistemology, evidence is what justifies beliefs or what makes it rational to hold a certain doxastic attitude. 　For example, a perceptual experience of a tree may act as evidence that justifies the belief that there is a tree. 　In this role, evidence is usually understood as a private mental state. 　Important topics in this field include the questions of what the nature of these mental states is, for example, whether they have to be propositional, and whether misleading mental states can still qualify as evidence. 　In phenomenology, evidence is understood in a similar sense. 　Here, however, it is limited to intuitive knowledge that provides immediate access to truth and is therefore indubitable. 　In this role, it is supposed to provide ultimate justifications for basic philosophical principles and thus turn philosophy into a rigorous science. 　However, it is highly controversial whether evidence can meet these requirements. 　Other fields, including the sciences and the law, tend to emphasize more the public nature of evidence (for example, scientists tend to focus on how the data used during statistical inference are generated). 　In philosophy of science, evidence is understood as that which confirms or disconfirms scientific hypotheses. 　Measurements of Mercury's "anomalous" orbit, for example, are seen as evidence that confirms Einstein's theory of general relativity. 　In order to play the role of neutral arbiter between competing theories, it is important that scientific evidence is public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events, so that the proponents of the different theories can agree on what the evidence is. 　This is ensured by following the scientific method and tends to lead to an emerging scientific consensus through the gradual accumulation of evidence. 　Two issues for the scientific conception of evidence are the problem of underdetermination, i.e. that the available evidence may support competing theories equally well, and theory-ladenness, i.e. that what some scientists consider the evidence to be may already involve various theoretical assumptions not shared by other scientists. 　It is often held that there are two kinds of evidence: intellectual evidence or what is self-evident and empirical evidence or evidence accessible through the senses. 　In order for something to act as evidence for a hypothesis, it has to stand in the right relation to it. 　In philosophy, this is referred to as the "evidential relation" and there are competing theories about what this relation has to be like. 　Probabilistic approaches hold that something counts as evidence if it increases the probability of the supported hypothesis. 　According to hypothetico-deductivism, evidence consists in observational consequences of the hypothesis. 　The positive-instance approach states that an observation sentence is evidence for a universal hypothesis if the sentence describes a positive instance of this hypothesis. 　The evidential relation can occur in various degrees of strength. 　These degrees range from direct proof of the truth of a hypothesis to weak evidence that is merely consistent with the hypothesis but does not rule out other, competing hypotheses, as in circumstantial evidence. 　In law, rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. 　Types of legal evidence include testimony, documentary evidence, and physical evidence. 　The parts of a legal case that are not in controversy are known, in general, as the "facts of the case." 　Beyond any facts that are undisputed, a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a trier of fact for the other issues of a case. 　Evidence and rules are used to decide questions of fact that are disputed, some of which may be determined by the legal burden of proof relevant to the case. 　Evidence in certain cases (e.g. capital crimes) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g. minor civil disputes), which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship>Ship</a> </h2>
<p>A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. 　Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. 　Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization and science. 　After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to world population growth. 　Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce. 　The word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged. 　As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons. 　Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships. 　The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kept>Kept</a> </h2>
<p>Kept is a reality television series that centered on Jerry Hall (model and ex-wife to Mick Jagger) searching for a kept man. 　The show premiered on the American cable network VH1 in late May 2005. 　When Hall narrowed the list down to twelve, she spirited them off to London and eliminated them one by one. 　The final three consisted of Anwar, Austen and Seth. 　In the August 4 finale, Hall was torn between Austen and Seth but ultimately chose Seth as he knew how to have fun and she thought he had matured throughout the process. 　Seth claims that he got his $100,000 in prize money but after filming stopped he never saw Jerry, the penthouse apartment, or the Lamborghini again.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management>Management</a> </h2>
<p>Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a nonprofit organization, or a government body. 　It is the art and science of managing resources of the business. 　Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. 　"Run the business" and "Change the business" are two concepts that are used in management to differentiate between the continued delivery of goods or services and adapting of goods or services to meet the changing needs of customers - see trend. 　The term "management" may also refer to those people who manage an organization—managers. 　Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management includes the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.), Master of Business Administration (MBA.), Master in Management (MSM or MIM) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree. 　Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the PhD in Business Administration or Management. 　In the past few decades, there has been a movement for evidence-based management. 　Larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, in a pyramid structure: Senior managers such as members of a board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization sets the strategic goals and policy of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. 　Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals who provide direction to middle management, and directly or indirectly report to them. 　Middle managers such as branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers, who provide direction to the front-line managers. 　They communicate the strategic goals and policy of senior management to the front-line managers. 　Line managers such as supervisors and front-line team leaders, oversee the work of regular employees (or volunteers, in some voluntary organizations) and provide direction on their work. 　Line managers often perform the managerial functions that are traditionally considered as the core of management. 　Despite the name, they are usually considered part of the workforce and not part of the organization's management class. 　In smaller organizations, a manager may have a much wider scope and may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization. 　Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization, organizational adaptation, and organizational leadership.</p>

<p>In human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. 　The distal part of the upper limb between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or "lower" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand. 　By anatomical definitions, the bones, ligaments and skeletal muscles of the shoulder girdle, as well as the axilla between them, is considered parts of the upper limb, and thus also components of the arm. 　The Latin term brachium, which serves as a root word for naming many anatomical structures, may refer to either the upper limb as a whole or to the upper arm on its own.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention>Attention</a> </h2>
<p>Attention in psychology is the concentration of awareness on some phenomenon to the exclusion of other stimuli. 　A process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether considered subjective or objective. 　William James (1890) wrote that "Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence." 　Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources. 　Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data (at around one megabyte per second) can enter the bottleneck, leading to inattentional blindness. 　Attention remains a crucial area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology. 　Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons, and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes, which may include working memory and psychological vigilance. 　A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within psychopathology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury and its effects on attention. 　Attention also varies across cultures. 　The relationships between attention and consciousness are complex enough that they have warranted perennial philosophical exploration. 　Such exploration is both ancient and continually relevant, as it can have effects in fields ranging from mental health and the study of disorders of consciousness to artificial intelligence and its domains of research.</p>

<p>A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes. 　A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. 　A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases. 　A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. 　In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources. 　Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet. 　The library's clientele and services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library or academic library, for example. 　Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. 　Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet. 　The services that libraries offer are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination "library and information services", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently.</p>

<p>In molecular biology, a library is a collection of DNA fragments that is stored and propagated in a population of micro-organisms through the process of molecular cloning. 　There are different types of DNA libraries, including cDNA libraries (formed from reverse-transcribed RNA), genomic libraries (formed from genomic DNA) and randomized mutant libraries (formed by de novo gene synthesis where alternative nucleotides or codons are incorporated). 　DNA library technology is a mainstay of current molecular biology, genetic engineering, and protein engineering, and the applications of these libraries depend on the source of the original DNA fragments. 　There are differences in the cloning vectors and techniques used in library preparation, but in general each DNA fragment is uniquely inserted into a cloning vector and the pool of recombinant DNA molecules is then transferred into a population of bacteria (a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome or BAC library) or yeast such that each organism contains on average one construct (vector + insert). 　As the population of organisms is grown in culture, the DNA molecules contained within them are copied and propagated (thus, "cloned").</p>
