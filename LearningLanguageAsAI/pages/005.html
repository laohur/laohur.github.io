<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information>Information</a> </h2>
<p>Information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform. 　At the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed. 　Any natural process that is not completely random, and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information. 　Whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information, other phenomena and artifacts such as analog signals, poems, pictures, music or other sounds, and currents convey information in a more continuous form. 　Information is not knowledge itself, but the meaning that may be derived from a representation through interpretation. 　Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step. 　For example, in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of, each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of, each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of, and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in a given domain. 　In a digital signal, bits may be interpreted into the symbols, letters, numbers, or structures that convey the information available at the next level up. 　The key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing. 　The concept of information is relevant in various contexts, including those of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy. 　The derivation of information from a signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message. 　Information may be structured as data. 　Redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size, which is the theoretical limit of compression. 　The information available through a collection of data may be derived by analysis. 　For example, data may be collected from a single customer's order at a restaurant. 　The information available from many orders may be analyzed, and then becomes knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish. 　Information can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via communication and telecommunication. 　Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. 　That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, all information is always conveyed as the content of a message. 　Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). 　It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication. 　The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. 　Uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. 　Information theory takes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. 　The bit is a typical unit of information. 　It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'. 　Other units such as the nat may be used. 　For example, the information encoded in one "fair" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. 　A 2011 Science article estimated that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in 2007, and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park>Park</a> </h2>
<p>A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. 　Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. 　National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. 　State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. 　Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. 　Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. 　Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. 　Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. 　Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. 　The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. 　In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit. 　Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g. rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). 　Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger. 　Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months. 　There are also amusement parks that have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_(topology)>Development (topology)</a> </h2>
<p>In the mathematical field of topology, a development is a countable collection of open covers of a topological space that satisfies certain separation axioms. 　Let X {\displaystyle X} be a topological space. 　A development for X {\displaystyle X} is a countable collection F 1 , F 2 , … {\displaystyle F_{1},F_{2},\ldots } of open coverings of X {\displaystyle X} , such that for any closed subset C ⊂ X {\displaystyle C\subset X} and any point p {\displaystyle p} in the complement of C {\displaystyle C} , there exists a cover F j {\displaystyle F_{j}} such that no element of F j {\displaystyle F_{j}} which contains p {\displaystyle p} intersects C {\displaystyle C} . 　A space with a development is called developable. 　A development F 1 , F 2 , … {\displaystyle F_{1},F_{2},\ldots } such that F i + 1 ⊂ F i {\displaystyle F_{i+1}\subset F_{i}} for all i {\displaystyle i} is called a nested development. 　A theorem from Vickery states that every developable space in fact has a nested development. 　If F i + 1 {\displaystyle F_{i+1}} is a refinement of F i {\displaystyle F_{i}} , for all i {\displaystyle i} , then the development is called a refined development. 　Vickery's theorem implies that a topological space is a Moore space if and only if it is regular and developable.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street>Street</a> </h2>
<p>A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment. 　It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. 　A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick. 　Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic. 　Originally, the word street simply meant a paved road (Latin: via strata). 　The word street is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for road, for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street, but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction. 　Examples of streets include pedestrian streets, alleys, and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass. 　Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(ecology)>Community (ecology)</a> </h2>
<p>In ecology, a community is a group or association of populations of two or more different species occupying the same geographical area at the same time, also known as a biocoenosis, biotic community, biological community, ecological community, or life assemblage. 　The term community has a variety of uses. 　In its simplest form it refers to groups of organisms in a specific place or time, for example, "the fish community of Lake Ontario before industrialization". 　Community ecology or synecology is the study of the interactions between species in communities on many spatial and temporal scales, including the distribution, structure, abundance, demography, and interactions between coexisting populations. 　The primary focus of community ecology is on the interactions between populations as determined by specific genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. 　Community ecology also takes into account abiotic factors that influence species distributions or interactions (e.g. annual temperature or soil pH). 　For example, the plant communities inhabiting deserts are very different from those found in tropical rainforests due to differences in annual precipitation. 　Humans can also affect community structure through habitat disturbance, such as the introduction of invasive species. 　On a deeper level the meaning and value of the community concept in ecology is up for debate. 　Communities have traditionally been understood on a fine scale in terms of local processes constructing (or destructing) an assemblage of species, such as the way climate change is likely to affect the make-up of grass communities. 　Recently this local community focus has been criticised. 　Robert Ricklefs has argued that it is more useful to think of communities on a regional scale, drawing on evolutionary taxonomy and biogeography, where some species or clades evolve and others go extinct.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community>Community</a> </h2>
<p>A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as place, norms, religion, values, customs, or identity. 　Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. 　Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. 　Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, "community" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. 　The English-language word "community" derives from the Old French comuneté (Modern French: communauté), which comes from the Latin communitas "community", "public spirit" (from Latin communis, "common"). 　Human communities may have intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office>Office</a> </h2>
<p>An office is a space where an organization's employees perform administrative work in order to support and realize objects and goals of the organization. 　The word "office" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. 　When used as an adjective, the term "office" may refer to business-related tasks. 　In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk-and-chair. 　An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. 　In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions. 　According to James Stephenson, "Office is that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities." 　Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. 　The High Middle Ages (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval chancery, which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. 　With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed. 　As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and telegraphy grew dramatically, requiring many clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities. 　The time-and-motion study, pioneered in manufacturing by F. W. Taylor (1856-1915) led to the "Modern Efficiency Desk" of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers. 　However, by the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy, and gradually the cubicle system evolved. 　The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs. 　Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing, and computer work. 　There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities. 　In addition to individual cubicles, one can find meeting rooms, lounges, and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing. 　Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches. 　There are many[quantify] different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial fashions and the culture of specific companies can be even more important. 　While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security. 　The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers. 　These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas. 　The chief operating officer (COO) is responsible for handling administration and maintenance of an office building.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God>God</a> </h2>
<p>In monotheistic thought, God is usually viewed as the supreme being, creator, and principal object of faith. 　Views regarding God vary considerably. 　Many notable theologians and philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God. 　Atheism rejects the belief in any deity. 　Agnosticism is the belief that the existence of God is unknown or unknowable. 　Among theists, some view knowledge concerning God as something derived from faith and God is often conceived as the greatest conceivable existent. 　God is often believed to be the cause of all things and so is seen as the creator and sustainer and the ruler of the universe. 　God is often thought of as incorporeal and independent of the material creation while pantheism holds God is the universe itself. 　God is sometimes seen as the most benevolent, while deism holds that God is not involved in humanity apart from creation. 　Some traditions attach spiritual significance to the relationship with God and see God as the source of all moral obligation, with acts such as worship and prayer. 　God is sometimes described without reference to gender, while others use terminology that is gender-specific. 　God is referred to by different names depending on the language and cultural tradition with titles also used to refer to different attributes.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy>Energy</a> </h2>
<p>In physics, energy (from Ancient Greek: ἐνέργεια, enérgeia, “activity”) is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. 　Energy is a conserved quantity—the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. 　The unit of measurement for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J). 　Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object (for instance due to its position in a field), the elastic energy stored in a solid object, chemical energy associated with chemical reactions, the radiant energy carried by electromagnetic radiation, and the internal energy contained within a thermodynamic system. 　All living organisms constantly take in and release energy. 　Due to mass–energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. 　Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy. 　The Earth's climate and ecosystems processes are driven by the energy the planet receives from the Sun (although a small amount is also contributed by geothermal energy).</p>

<p>A council is a group of people who come together to consult, deliberate, or make decisions. 　A council may function as a legislature, especially at a town, city or county/shire level, but most legislative bodies at the state/provincial or national level are not considered councils. 　At such levels, there may be no separate executive branch, and the council may effectively represent the entire government. 　A board of directors might also be denoted as a council. 　A committee might also be denoted as a council, though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be. 　Because many schools have a student council, the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first experience as electors or participants. 　A member of a council may be referred to as a councillor or councilperson, or by the gender-specific titles of councilman and councilwoman.</p>

<p>Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. 　It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres. 　It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. 　Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. 　Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. 　The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. 　It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces.　: 60–61  In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. 　The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. 　Red became a symbolic color of communism and socialism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. 　Communist China adopted the red flag following the Chinese Revolution of 1949. 　It was adopted by North Vietnam in 1954, and by all of Vietnam in 1975. 　Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. 　Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. 　In China, India, and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune.　: 39–63</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land>Land</a> </h2>
<p>Land, also known as dry land, ground, or earth, is the solid terrestrial surface of Earth not submerged by the ocean or another body of water. 　It makes up 29.2% of Earth's surface and includes all continents and islands. 　Earth's land surface is almost entirely covered by regolith, a layer of rock, soil, and minerals that forms the outer part of the crust. 　Land plays important roles in Earth's climate system and is involved in the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and water cycle. 　One third of land is covered in trees, another third is used for agriculture, and 10% is covered in permanent snow and glaciers. 　Land terrain varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, glaciers, and other landforms. 　In physical geology, the land is divided into two major categories: Mountain ranges and relatively flat interiors called cratons. 　Both are formed over millions of years through plate tectonics. 　Streams – a major part of Earth's water cycle – shape the landscape, carve rocks, transport sediments, and replenish groundwater. 　At high elevations or latitudes, snow is compacted and recrystallized over hundreds or thousands of years to form glaciers, which can be so heavy that they warp the Earth's crust. 　About 30 percent of land has a dry climate, due to losing more water through evaporation than it gains from precipitation. 　Since warm air rises, this generates winds, though Earth's rotation and uneven sun distribution also play a part. 　Land is commonly defined as the solid, dry surface of Earth. 　The word land may also collectively refer to land cover, rivers, shallow lakes, natural resources, non-marine fauna and flora (biosphere), the lower portions of the atmosphere (troposphere), groundwater reserves, and the physical results of human activity on land, such as architecture and agriculture. 　Even though saturated land, or mud, is common away from the ocean, the shoreline is referred to as where dry land begins for anyone in a body of water. 　Though modern terrestrial plants and animals evolved from aquatic creatures, Earth's first cellular life likely originated on land. 　Survival on land depends on fresh water from rivers, streams, lakes, and glaciers, which constitute only three percent of the water on Earth. 　The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that are habitable and support agriculture and various natural resources. 　In recent decades, scientists and policymakers have emphasized the need to manage land and its biosphere more sustainably, notably by restoring degraded soil, preserving biodiversity, protecting endangered species, and addressing climate change.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(biology)>Division (biology)</a> </h2>
<p>Division is a taxonomic rank in biological classification that is used differently in zoology and in botany. 　In botany and mycology, division refers to a rank equivalent to phylum. 　The use of either term is allowed under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, and both are commonly used in scientific literature. 　The main Divisions of land plants, in the order in which they probably evolved, are the Marchantiophyta (liverworts), Anthocerotophyta (hornworts), Bryophyta (mosses), Filicophyta (ferns), Sphenophyta (horsetails), Cycadophyta (cycads), Ginkgophyta (ginkgo)s, Pinophyta (conifers), Gnetophyta (gnetophytes), and the Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms, flowering plants). 　The flowering plants now dominate terrestrial ecosystems, comprising 80% of vascular plant species. 　In zoology, the term division is applied to an optional rank subordinate to the infraclass and superordinate to the cohort. 　A widely used classification (e.g. Carroll 1988) recognises teleost fishes as a Division Teleostei within Class Actinopterygii (the ray-finned fishes). 　Less commonly (as in Milner 1988), living tetrapods are ranked as Divisions Amphibia and Amniota within the clade of vertebrates with fleshy limbs (Sarcopterygii).</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business>Business</a> </h2>
<p>Business is the practice of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). 　It is also "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit." 　Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. 　If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. 　A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. 　The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business. 　The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company, such as a corporation or cooperative. 　Corporations, in contrast with sole proprietors and partnerships, are a separate legal entity and provide limited liability for their owners/members, as well as being subject to corporate tax rates. 　A corporation is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owners/members.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region>Region</a> </h2>
<p>In geography, regions, otherwise referred to as zones, lands or territories, are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). 　Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. 　Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. 　The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features. 　As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. 　For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. 　The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. 　Regions are an area or division, especially part of a country or the world having definable characteristics but not always fixed boundaries. 　In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. 　Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force>Force</a> </h2>
<p>In physics, a force is an influence that can change the motion of an object. 　A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (e.g. moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. 　Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. 　A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. 　It is measured in the SI unit of newton (N). 　Force is represented by the symbol F (formerly P). 　The original form of Newton's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. 　If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object. 　Concepts related to force include: thrust, which increases the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. 　In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. 　Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another. 　Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. 　Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human>Human</a> </h2>
<p>Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate. 　They are a type of great ape that is characterized by bipedalism and exceptional cognitive skills due to a large and complex brain. 　Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. 　As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which bolsters human society. 　The desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields of study. 　Although some scientists equate the term "humans" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. 　Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. 　For most of history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. 　Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago. 　The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. 　As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities, and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. 　Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 8 billion as of 2022[update]. 　Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. 　Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. 　Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. 　At puberty, humans develop secondary sexual characteristics. 　Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50. 　Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. 　Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and three or four days without water. 　Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. 　Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. 　Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth. 　Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. 　They are highly intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. 　The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. 　This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development to be possible through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations. 　Language, art, and trade are defining characteristics of humans. 　Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman>Woman</a> </h2>
<p>A woman is an adult female human. 　Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent). 　The plural women is sometimes used in certain phrases such as "women's rights" to denote female humans regardless of age. 　Typically, women inherit a pair of X chromosomes, one from each parent, and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. 　More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. 　Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. 　A fully developed woman generally has a wider pelvis, broader hips, and larger breasts than an adult man. 　Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men. 　Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities, resulting in gender inequality; many religious doctrines and legal systems stipulate certain rules for women. 　With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker, and the ability to pursue higher education. 　Violence against women, whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men. 　Some women are denied reproductive rights. 　The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality. 　Trans women have a gender identity that does not align with their male sex assignment at birth, while intersex women may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Award>Award</a> </h2>
<p>An award, sometimes called a distinction, is something given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field. 　When the token is a medal, ribbon or other item designed for wearing, it is known as a decoration. 　An award may be described by three aspects: 　1) who is given 　2) what 　3) by whom, all varying according to purpose. 　The recipient is often to a single person, such as a student or athlete, or a representative of a group of people, be it an organisation, a sports team or a whole country. 　The award item may be a decoration, that is an insignia suitable for wearing, such as a medal, badge, or rosette (award). 　It can also be a token object such as certificate, diploma, championship belt, trophy, or plaque. 　The award may also be or be accompanied by a title of honor, as well as an object of direct value such as prize money or a scholarship. 　Furthermore, an honorable mention is an award given, typically in education, that does not confer the recipient(s) a higher standing but is considered worth mentioning in an honourable way. 　An award may be conferred as a state decoration by sovereign state, dynasty or other public authority (see fount of honour), or else a private organisation or individual. 　The latter may also include ecclesiastical authorities, such as in the case of ecclesiastical awards. 　For example, the Nobel Prize recognizes contributions to society, while the Pulitzer prize honors literary achievements. 　An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize. 　Awards for sports tournaments often take the form of cups, following a tradition harking back to the ancient Greek tripod given to winners in athletic contests. 　The Stanley Cup is a modern example. 　In contrast, awards for employee recognition often take the form of plaques or crystal pieces. 　An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient. 　Finally, an award may recognize participation rather than victory. 　There is controversy regarding the appropriateness of participation awards for students in United States schools. 　A relative field to awards is phaleristics, an auxiliary science of history and numismatics which studies orders, fraternities and award items, such as medals and other decorations.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost>Almost</a> </h2>
<p>In set theory, when dealing with sets of infinite size, the term almost or nearly is used to refer to all but a negligible amount of elements in the set. 　The notion of "negligible" depends on the context, and may mean "of measure zero" (in a measure space), "finite" (when infinite sets are involved), or "countable" (when uncountably infinite sets are involved). 　For example: The set S = { n ∈ N | n ≥ k } {\displaystyle S=\{n\in \mathbb {N} \,|\,n\geq k\}} is almost N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } for any k {\displaystyle k} in N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , because only finitely many natural numbers are less than k {\displaystyle k} . 　The set of prime numbers is not almost N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , because there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not prime numbers. 　The set of transcendental numbers are almost R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , because the algebraic real numbers form a countable subset of the set of real numbers (which is uncountable). 　The Cantor set is uncountably infinite, but has Lebesgue measure zero. 　So almost all real numbers in (0, 1) are members of the complement of the Cantor set.</p>
