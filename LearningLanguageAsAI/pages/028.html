<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth>Birth</a> </h2>
<p>Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. 　In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. 　In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. 　In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestation and develops further in its mother's womb pouch. 　It is not only mammals that give birth. 　Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. 　Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen>Kitchen</a> </h2>
<p>A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. 　A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. 　Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances. 　The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing). 　The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry. 　The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world. 　Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments. 　These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen. 　For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine. 　In some instances, commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks is used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability. 　In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws. 　They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.　[citation needed]</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera>Opera</a> </h2>
<p>Opera is a form of theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers. 　Such a "work" (the literal translation of the Italian word "opera") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet. 　The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. 　Although musical theatre is closely related to opera, the two are considered to be distinct from one another. 　Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition. 　Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include numerous genres, including some that include spoken dialogue such as Singspiel and Opéra comique. 　In traditional number opera, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style, and self-contained arias. 　The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama. 　Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's mostly lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) especially from works by Claudio Monteverdi, notably L'Orfeo, and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. 　In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel. 　Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. 　The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as Die Entführung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio), and The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), landmarks in the German tradition. 　The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating signature works of that style. 　It also saw the advent of grand opera typified by the works of Daniel Auber and Giacomo Meyerbeer as well as Carl Maria von Weber's introduction of German Romantische Oper (German Romantic Opera). 　The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany. 　The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century. 　During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. 　The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). 　With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. 　Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media. 　Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world. 　Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(archaeology)>Survey (archaeology)</a> </h2>
<p>In archaeology, survey or field survey is a type of field research by which archaeologists (often landscape archaeologists) search for archaeological sites and collect information about the location, distribution and organization of past human cultures across a large area (e.g. typically in excess of one hectare, and often in excess of many km2). 　Archaeologists conduct surveys to search for particular archaeological sites or kinds of sites, to detect patterns in the distribution of material culture over regions, to make generalizations or test hypotheses about past cultures, and to assess the risks that development projects will have adverse impacts on archaeological heritage. 　The surveys may be: 　(a) intrusive or non-intrusive, depending on the needs of the survey team (and the risk of destroying archaeological evidence if intrusive methods are used) and; 　(b) extensive or intensive, depending on the types of research questions being asked of the landscape in question. 　Surveys can be a practical way to decide whether or not to carry out an excavation (as a way of recording the basic details of a possible site), but may also be ends in themselves, as they produce important information about past human activities in a regional context. 　A common role of a field survey is in assessment of the potential archaeological significance of places where development is proposed. 　This is usually connected to construction work and road building. 　The assessment determines whether the area of development impact is likely to contain significant archaeological resources and makes recommendations as to whether the archaeological remains can be avoided or an excavation is necessary before development work can commence. 　Archaeologists use a variety of tools when carrying out surveys, including GIS, GPS, remote sensing, geophysical survey and aerial photography.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan>Michigan</a> </h2>
<p>Michigan (/ˈmɪʃɪɡən/ (listen)) is a state in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwestern United States. 　With a population of nearly 10.12 million and an area of nearly 97,000 sq mi (250,000 km2), Michigan is the 10th-largest state by population, the 11th-largest by area, and the largest by area east of the Mississippi River. 　Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. 　Metro Detroit is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. 　Its name derives from a gallicized variant of the original Ojibwe word ᒥᓯᑲᒥ (mishigami), meaning "large water" or "large lake". 　Michigan consists of two peninsulas. 　The Lower Peninsula resembles the shape of a mitten, and comprises a majority of the state's land area. 　The Upper Peninsula (often called "the U.P.") is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, a five-mile (8 km) channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. 　The Mackinac Bridge connects the peninsulas. 　Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the United States, being bordered by four of the five Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair. 　It also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds. 　Michigan has the second-most water of any state, behind only Alaska. 　The area was first occupied by a succession of Native American tribes over thousands of years. 　In the 17th century, French explorers claimed it as part of the New France colony, when it was largely inhabited by indigenous peoples. 　French and Canadian traders and settlers, Métis, and others migrated to the area, settling largely along the waterways. 　After France's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762, the region came under British rule. 　Britain ceded the territory to the newly independent United States after Britain's defeat in the American Revolutionary War. 　The area was part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800, when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory. 　Michigan Territory was formed in 1805, but some of the northern border with Canada was not agreed upon until after the War of 1812. 　Michigan was admitted into the Union in 1837 as the 26th state, a free one. 　It soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region, attracting immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from many European countries. 　Immigrants from Finland, Macedonia, and the Netherlands were especially numerous. 　Migration from Appalachia and of Black Southerners as part of the Great Migration increased in the 1930s, with many settling in Metro Detroit. 　Although Michigan has developed a diverse economy, in the early 20th century it became widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, which developed as a major national economic force. 　It is home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). 　Once exploited for logging and mining, today the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula is important for tourism due to the abundance of natural resources. 　The Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, services, and high-tech industry.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog>Dog</a> </h2>
<p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 　Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 　Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. 　Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. 　The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. 　Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. 　They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. 　Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. 　This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain>Chain</a> </h2>
<p>A chain is a serial assembly of connected pieces, called links, typically made of metal, with an overall character similar to that of a rope in that it is flexible and curved in compression but linear, rigid, and load-bearing in tension. 　A chain may consist of two or more links. 　Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: Those designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). 　Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types. 　Those designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. 　They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chains. 　Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis. 　Load can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet>Internet</a> </h2>
<p>The Internet (or internet) is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. 　It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 　The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. 　The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. 　The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s to enable resource sharing. 　The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. 　The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. 　Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life. 　Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. 　Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology or being reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. 　The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. 　Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. 　Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries. 　The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. 　The overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). 　The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. 　In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today's list of New Seven Wonders.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate>Climate</a> </h2>
<p>Climate is the long-term weather pattern in a region, typically averaged over 30 years. 　More rigorously, it is the mean and variability of meteorological variables over a time spanning from months to millions of years. 　Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. 　In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and biosphere and the interactions between them. 　The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, longitude, terrain, altitude, land use and nearby water bodies and their currents. 　Climates can be classified according to the average and typical variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. 　The most widely used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. 　The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. 　Finally, the Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. 　Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. 　Paleoclimatologists seek to explain climate variations for all parts of the Earth during any given geologic period, beginning with the time of the Earth's formation. 　Since very few direct observations of climate were available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables. 　They include non-biotic evidence—such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores—and biotic evidence—such as tree rings and coral. 　Climate models are mathematical models of past, present, and future climates. 　Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from various factors. 　Recent warming is discussed in global warming, which results in redistributions. 　For example, "a 3 °C [5 °F] change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km [190–250 mi] in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m [1,600 ft] in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones."</p>

<p>The matrix or groundmass of a rock is the finer-grained mass of material in which larger grains, crystals, or clasts are embedded. 　The matrix of an igneous rock consists of finer-grained, often microscopic, crystals in which larger crystals, called phenocrysts, are embedded. 　This porphyritic texture is indicative of multi-stage cooling of magma. 　For example, porphyritic andesite will have large phenocrysts of plagioclase in a fine-grained matrix. 　Also in South Africa, diamonds are often mined from a matrix of weathered clay-like rock (kimberlite) called "yellow ground". 　The matrix of sedimentary rocks is finer-grained sedimentary material, such as clay or silt, in which larger grains or clasts are embedded. 　It is also used to describe the rock material in which a fossil is embedded.</p>
