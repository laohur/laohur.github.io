<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship>Citizenship</a> </h2>
<p>Citizenship is an allegiance of person to a state. 　Each state determines the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn. 　Recognition by a state as a citizen generally carries with it recognition of civil, political, and social rights which are not afforded to non-citizens. 　In general, the basic rights normally regarded as arising from citizenship are the right to a passport, the right to leave and return to the country/ies of citizenship, the right to live in that country, and to work there. 　Some countries permit their citizens to have multiple citizenships, while others insist on exclusive allegiance.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing>Sailing</a> </h2>
<p>Sailing craft and their rigs Sailing employs the wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft on the surface of the water (sailing ship, sailboat, raft, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of navigation. 　From prehistory until the second half of the 19th century, sailing craft were the primary means of maritime trade and transportation; exploration across the seas and oceans was reliant on sail for anything other than the shortest distances. 　Naval power in this period used sail to varying degrees depending on the current technology, culminating in the gun-armed sailing warships of the Age of Sail. 　Sail was slowly replaced by steam as the method of propulsion for ships over the latter part of the 19th century – seeing a gradual improvement in the technology of steam through a number of stepwise developments. 　Steam allowed scheduled services that ran at higher average speeds than sailing vessels. 　Large improvements in fuel economy allowed steam to progressively outcompete sail in, ultimately, all commercial situations, giving ship-owning investors a better return on capital.　: 9, 16  In the 21st century, most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport. 　Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising. 　Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips, coastal sailing within sight of land, and daysailing. 　Sailing relies on the physics of sails as they derive power from the wind, generating both lift and drag. 　On a given course, the sails are set to an angle that optimizes the development of wind power, as determined by the apparent wind, which is the wind as sensed from a moving vessel. 　The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft which are steering the course. 　This combination of forces means that it is possible to sail an upwind course as well as downwind. 　The course with respect to the true wind direction (as would be indicated by a stationary flag) is called a point of sail. 　Conventional sailing craft cannot derive wind power on a course with a point of sail that is too close into the wind.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial>Editorial</a> </h2>
<p>An editorial, or leading article (UK) or leader (UK) is an article written by the senior editorial people or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document, often unsigned. 　Australian and major United States newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Boston Globe, often classify editorials under the heading "opinion". 　Illustrated editorials may appear in the form of editorial cartoons. 　Typically, a newspaper's editorial board evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion on. 　Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features letters to the editor from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the op-ed page and frequently contains opinion pieces (hence the name think pieces) by writers not directly affiliated with the publication. 　However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. 　In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Denmark, Spain, Italy, and France. 　Many newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer. 　Tom Clark, leader-writer for The Guardian, says that it ensures readers discuss the issue at hand rather than the author. 　On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. 　Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility. 　In the field of fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to photo-editorials – features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins>Ruins</a> </h2>
<p>Ruins (from Latin ruina 'a collapse') are the remains of a civilization's architecture. 　The term refers to formerly intact structures that have fallen into a state of partial or total disrepair over time due to a variety of factors, such as lack of maintenance, deliberate destruction by humans, or uncontrollable destruction by natural phenomena. 　The most common root causes that yield ruins in their wake are natural disasters, armed conflict, and population decline, with many structures becoming progressively derelict over time due to long-term weathering and scavenging. 　There are famous ruins all over the world, with notable sites originating from ancient China, the Indus Valley and other regions of ancient India, ancient Iran, ancient Israel and Judea, ancient Iraq, ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, Roman sites throughout the Mediterranean Basin, and Incan and Mayan sites in the Americas. 　Ruins are of great importance to historians, archaeologists and anthropologists, whether they were once individual fortifications, places of worship, ancient universities, houses and utility buildings, or entire villages, towns, and cities. 　Many ruins have become UNESCO World Heritage Sites in recent years, to identify and preserve them as areas of outstanding value to humanity.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal>Nepal</a> </h2>
<p>Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/; Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), formally the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल), is a landlocked country in South Asia. 　It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. 　Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. 　Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. 　Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. 　The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. 　In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. 　Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. 　The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. 　The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. 　The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. 　By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. 　The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. 　The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. 　Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. 　The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy. 　The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. 　Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. 　Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. 　Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. 　The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p>

<p>In geology, basement and crystalline basement are crystalline rocks lying above the mantle and beneath all other rocks and sediments. 　They are sometimes exposed at the surface, but often they are buried under miles of rock and sediment. 　The basement rocks lie below a sedimentary platform or cover, or more generally any rock below sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are metamorphic or igneous in origin. 　In the same way, the sediments or sedimentary rocks on top of the basement can be called a "cover" or "sedimentary cover". 　Crustal rocks are modified several times before they become basement, and these transitions alter their composition.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite_(geology)>Suite (geology)</a> </h2>
<p>In geology, a suite is a lithodemic unit consisting of two or more lithodemes of a single genetic class (metamorphic, igneous or sedimentary). 　The law of superposition is inapplicable to intrusive, highly deformed, or metamorphic bodies of rock lacking discernible stratification. 　Such bodies of rock are described as lithodemic and are determined and delimited based on rock characteristics. 　The 1983 North American Stratigraphic Code adopted the formal term lithodeme, which is comparable to a formation. 　A lithodeme is the fundamental unit and should possess distinctive and consistent lithological features, comprising a single rock type or a mixture of two or more types that distinguishes the unit from those around it. 　A suite is a group of two or more lithodemes of a single genetic class. 　It differs from a complex, which is a group of two or more lithodemes of different genetic classes.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_(game terminology)>Item (game terminology)</a> </h2>
<p>In pencil and paper games and computer and video games, an item is an object within the game world that can be collected by a player or, occasionally, a non-player character. 　These items are sometimes called pick-ups. 　Items are most often beneficial to the player character. 　Some games contain detrimental items, such as cursed pieces of armor that confers a negative bonus to the wearer and cannot be removed until the curse itself is lifted; the means to do this may be costly or require a special item. 　Some items may also be of absolutely no value to the player. 　Items are especially prevalent in role-playing games, as they are usually necessary for the completion of quests or to advance through the story. 　Sometimes certain items may be unique, and only appear once at a specific location, often after completing a particular task. 　Other items may appear frequently, and not give a big bonus alone, but when many are collected. 　Games may differ on how the player uses an item. 　Some games, many in the Mario and Sonic series, an item is automatically used when the player character comes into contact with it. 　There are also games, such as those in the Streets of Rage series, and the first Prince of Persia games where the player character may walk over an item without collecting it, if they do not need it yet, and the player must push a particular button for the character to collect it, but it still used immediately, when the button is pressed. 　Other times, some games, like many role playing games, an item can be collected either automatically or manually, but will not be used immediately, the item can be carried around and used manually either straight away if they wish or at a later time when the player needs it.</p>

<p>A missionary is a member of a religious group which is sent into an area in order to promote its faith or provide services to people, such as education, literacy, social justice, health care, and economic development. 　In the Latin translation of the Bible, Jesus Christ says the word when he sends the disciples into areas and commands them to preach the gospel in his name. 　The term is most commonly used in reference to Christian missions, but it can also be used in reference to any creed or ideology. 　The word mission originated in 1598 when Jesuits, the members of the Society of Jesus sent members abroad, derived from the Latin missionem (nom. missio), meaning 'act of sending' or mittere, meaning 'to send'.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption>Adoption</a> </h2>
<p>Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. 　Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents. 　Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. 　Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation). 　Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_(theology)>Adoption (theology)</a> </h2>
<p>Adoption, in Christian theology, is the reception of a believer into the family of God. 　In the Reformed ordo salutis ("order of salvation"), adoption is usually regarded as a step immediately subsequent to justification. 　As a theological word, adoption has similar connotations to the act of parents who legally take responsibility for a child who was not originally born to them. 　There are three references in the New Testament to God "adopting" ('υιοθεσια) Christians as his own children (Galatians 4:5, Romans 8:15 and Ephesians 1:5) and one reference to God adopting "people of Israel" (Romans 9:4). 　Adoption as a theological term introduces a relational dimension to the consequences of salvation. 　Adoption as a theological concept is also another consequence of the 'legal' act of justification, alongside redemption and reconciliation. 　The Old Testament precedent for this term comes from the story of Mephibosheth, who despite not being part of Davidic family was included in the Royal inheritance (2 Samuel 9:7-13). 　Adoption is an important feature of Reformation theology as demonstrated by article 12 of the Westminster Confession of Faith: All those that are justified, God vouchsafes, in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing>Climbing</a> </h2>
<p>Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or other parts of the body to ascend a steep topographical object that can range from the world's tallest mountains (e.g. the eight thousanders) to small boulders. 　Climbing is done for locomotion, for sporting recreation, for competition, and is also done in trades that rely on ascension; such as rescue and military operations. 　Climbing is done indoors and outdoors, on natural surfaces (e.g. rock climbing and ice climbing), and on artificial surfaces (e.g. climbing walls). 　Professional mountain guides or rock climbing guides (e.g. the UIAGM), were a significant element in developing the popularity of the sport in the natural environment, and remain so today. 　Since the 1980s, the development of competition climbing and the availability of artificial climbing walls have dramatically increased the popularity of rock climbing as a sport, and led to the emergence of professional rock climbers, such as Wolfgang Güllich, Chris Sharma, Adam Ondra, Lynn Hill, Catherine Destivelle, and Janja Garnbret. 　Climbing became an Olympic sport for the first time in the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo (see Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics) for sport climbing and speed climbing disciplines.</p>

<p>Regret is the emotion of wishing one had made a different decision in the past, because the consequences of the decision one did make were unfavorable. 　Regret is related to perceived opportunity. 　Its intensity varies over time after the decision, in regard to action versus inaction, and in regard to self-control at a particular age. 　The self-recrimination which comes with regret is thought to spur corrective action and adaptation. 　In Western societies adults have the highest regrets regarding choices of their education.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tributary>Tributary</a> </h2>
<p>A tributary, or affluent, is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. 　A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. 　Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. 　The Irtysh is a chief tributary of the Ob river and is also the longest tributary river in the world with a length of 4,248 km (2,640 mi). 　The Madeira River is the largest tributary river by volume in the world with an average discharge of 31,200 m3/s (1.1 million cu ft/s). 　A confluence, where two or more bodies of water meet, usually refers to the joining of tributaries. 　The opposite to a tributary is a distributary, a river or stream that branches off from and flows away from the main stream. 　Distributaries are most often found in river deltas.</p>

<p>Nebraska (/nəˈbræskə/ (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. 　It is bordered by South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River; Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west. 　It is the only triply landlocked U.S. state. 　Indigenous peoples, including Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux) tribes, lived in the region for thousands of years before European exploration. 　The state is crossed by many historic trails, including that of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 　Nebraska's area is just over 77,220 square miles (200,000 km2) with a population of over 1.9 million. 　Its capital is Lincoln, and its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. 　Nebraska was admitted into the United States in 1867, two years after the end of the American Civil War. 　The Nebraska Legislature is unlike any other American legislature in that it is unicameral, and its members are elected without any official reference to political party affiliation. 　Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the Dissected Till Plains and the Great Plains. 　The Dissected Till Plains region consists of gently rolling hills and contains the state's largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln. 　The Great Plains region, occupying most of western Nebraska, is characterized by treeless prairie. 　Nebraska has two major climatic zones. 　The eastern two-thirds of the state has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa); a unique warmer subtype considered "warm-temperate" exists near the southern plains, which is analogous to that in Kansas and Oklahoma, which have a predominantly humid subtropical climate. 　The Panhandle and adjacent areas bordering Colorado have a primarily semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk). 　The state has wide variations between winter and summer temperatures, variations that decrease moving south within the state. 　Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes occur primarily during spring and summer and sometimes in autumn. 　Chinook wind tends to warm the state significantly in the winter and early spring.</p>
