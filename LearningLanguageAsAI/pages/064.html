<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire>Wire</a> </h2>
<p>A wire is a flexible strand of metal. 　Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate. 　Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number or cross-sectional area. 　Wires are used to bear mechanical loads, often in the form of wire rope. 　In electricity and telecommunications signals, a "wire" can refer to an electrical cable, which can contain a "solid core" of a single wire or separate strands in stranded or braided forms. 　Usually cylindrical in geometry, wire can also be made in square, hexagonal, flattened rectangular, or other cross-sections, either for decorative purposes, or for technical purposes such as high-efficiency voice coils in loudspeakers. 　Edge-wound coil springs, such as the Slinky toy, are made of special flattened wire.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread>Bread</a> </h2>
<p>Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour (usually wheat) and water, usually by baking. 　Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important part of many cultures' diet. 　It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture. 　Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes (e.g. sourdough), chemicals (e.g. baking soda), industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration, which creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread. 　In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant>Sergeant</a> </h2>
<p>Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt. and capitalized when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. 　The alternative spelling, serjeant, is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British light infantry. 　Its origin is the Latin serviens, 'one who serves', through the French term sergeant. 　The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal, and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant in the US, and below an inspector in the UK. 　In most armies, the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad (or section). 　In Commonwealth armies, it is a more senior rank, corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command. 　In the United States Army, sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a squad- (12 person) or platoon- (36 person) leader. 　More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant, for example staff sergeant, gunnery sergeant, master sergeant, first sergeant, and sergeant major. 　In many nations and services, the rank insignia for a sergeant often features three chevrons.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty>Poverty</a> </h2>
<p>Poverty is a state or condition in which a person lacks the financial resources and essentials for a certain standard of living. 　Poverty can have diverse social, economic, and political causes and effects. 　When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics there are two main measures: absolute poverty compares income against the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter; relative poverty measures when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. 　The definition of relative poverty varies from one country to another, or from one society to another. 　Statistically, as of 2019[update], most of the world's population live in poverty: in PPP dollars, 85% of people live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and 10% live on less than $1.90 per day now changed to 2.15$/day.　(extreme poverty). 　According to the World Bank Group in 2020, more than 40% of the poor live in conflict-affected countries. 　Even when countries experience economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an adequate share of their countries' increased wealth to leave poverty. 　Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies and programs for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies in urban areas. 　The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation, established by the United Nations in 2015, are summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: "No Poverty". 　Social forces, such as gender, disability, race and ethnicity, can exacerbate issues of poverty—with women, children and minorities frequently bearing unequal burdens of poverty. 　Moreover, impoverished individuals are more vulnerable to the effects of other social issues, such as the environmental effects of industry or the impacts of climate change or other natural disasters or extreme weather events. 　Poverty can also make other social problems worse; economic pressures on impoverished communities frequently play a part in deforestation, biodiversity loss and ethnic conflict. 　For this reason, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy programs, such as the international recovery from COVID-19, emphasize the connection of poverty alleviation with other societal goals.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus>Virus</a> </h2>
<p>A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. 　Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. 　Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, more than 9,000 of the millions of virus species have been described in detail. 　Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity. 　The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology. 　When infected, a host cell is often forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus. 　When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent viral particles, or virions, consisting of 　(i) the genetic material, i.e., long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; 　(ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases 　(iii) an outside envelope of lipids. 　The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. 　Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope and are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria. 　The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. 　In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction. 　Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack the key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining life. 　Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life" and as replicators. 　Viruses spread in many ways. 　One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. 　Many viruses, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, chickenpox, smallpox, and measles, spread in the air by coughing and sneezing. 　Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water. 　The infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is fewer than 100 particles. 　HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. 　The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its host range. 　This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many. 　Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. 　Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. 　Some viruses, including those that cause HIV/AIDS, HPV infection, and viral hepatitis, evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. 　Several classes of antiviral drugs have been developed.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm>Rhythm</a> </h2>
<p>Rhythm (from Greek ῥυθμός, rhythmos, "any regular recurring motion, symmetry") generally means a "movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions". 　This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. 　Rhythm is related to and distinguished from pulse, meter, and beats: Rhythm may be defined as the way in which one or more unaccented beats are grouped in relation to an accented one. 　... 　A rhythmic group can be apprehended only when its elements are distinguished from one another, rhythm...always involves an interrelationship between a single, accented (strong) beat and either one or two unaccented (weak) beats. 　In the performance arts, rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry. 　In some performing arts, such as hip hop music, the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style. 　Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as "timed movement through space" and a common language of pattern unites rhythm with geometry. 　For example, architects often speak of the rhythm of a building, referring to patterns in the spacing of windows, columns, and other elements of the façade.　[citation needed] In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. 　Recent work in these areas includes books by Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, Christopher Hasty, Godfried Toussaint, William Rothstein, Joel Lester, and Guerino Mazzola.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood>Flood</a> </h2>
<p>A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry. 　In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. 　Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. 　Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding, for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise. 　In particular climate change's increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases the severity of other causes for flooding, resulting in more intense floods and increased flood risk. 　Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. 　While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals. 　Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. 　Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. 　While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry. 　Flooding can lead to secondary consequences in addition to damage to property, such as long-term displacement of residents and creating increased spread of waterborne diseases and vector-bourne disesases transmitted by mosquitos.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan>Sultan</a> </h2>
<p>Sultan (/ˈsʌltən/; Arabic: سلطان sulṭān, pronounced [sʊlˈtˤɑːn, solˈtˤɑːn]) is a position with several historical meanings. 　Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning "strength", "authority", "rulership", derived from the verbal noun سلطة sulṭah, meaning "authority" or "power". 　Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty (i.e., not having dependence on any higher ruler) without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. 　The adjectival form of the word is "sultanic", and the state and territories ruled by a sultan, as well as his office, are referred to as a sultanate (سلطنة salṭanah). 　The term is distinct from king (ملك malik), despite both referring to a sovereign ruler. 　The use of "sultan" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular king, which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. 　Brunei and Oman are the only independent countries which retain the title "sultan" for their monarchs. 　In recent years, the title has been gradually replaced by "king" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law. 　A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient>Gradient</a> </h2>
<p>In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function f of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) ∇ f {\displaystyle \nabla f} whose value at a point p {\displaystyle p} is the "direction and rate of fastest increase". 　If the gradient of a function is non-zero at a point p, the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from p, and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction, the greatest absolute directional derivative. 　Further, a point where the gradient is the zero vector is known as a stationary point. 　The gradient thus plays a fundamental role in optimization theory, where it is used to maximize a function by gradient ascent. 　In coordinate-free terms, the gradient of a function f ( r ) {\displaystyle f({\bf {{r})}}} may be defined by: d f = ∇ f ⋅ d r {\displaystyle df=\nabla f\cdot d{\bf {r}}} where df is the total infinitesimal change in f for an infinitesimal displacement d r {\displaystyle d{\bf {r}}} , and is seen to be maximal when d r {\displaystyle d{\bf {r}}} is in the direction of the gradient ∇ f {\displaystyle \nabla f} . 　The nabla symbol ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } , written as an upside-down triangle and pronounced "del", denotes the vector differential operator. 　When a coordinate system is used in which the basis vectors are not functions of position, the gradient is given by the vector whose components are the partial derivatives of f {\displaystyle f} at p {\displaystyle p} . 　That is, for f : R n → R {\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} } , its gradient ∇ f : R n → R n {\displaystyle \nabla f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is defined at the point p = ( x 1 , … , x n ) {\displaystyle p=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} in n-dimensional space as the vector ∇ f ( p ) = [ ∂ f ∂ x 1 ( p ) ⋮ ∂ f ∂ x n ( p ) ] . 　{\displaystyle \nabla f(p)={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}}(p)\\\vdots \\{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}}(p)\end{bmatrix}}.　} The gradient is dual to the total derivative d f {\displaystyle df} : the value of the gradient at a point is a tangent vector – a vector at each point; while the value of the derivative at a point is a cotangent vector – a linear functional on vectors. 　They are related in that the dot product of the gradient of f at a point p with another tangent vector v equals the directional derivative of f at p of the function along v; that is, ∇ f ( p ) ⋅ v = ∂ f ∂ v ( p ) = d f p ( v ) {\textstyle \nabla f(p)\cdot \mathbf {v} ={\frac {\partial f}{\partial \mathbf {v} }}(p)=df_{p}(\mathbf {v} )} . 　The gradient admits multiple generalizations to more general functions on manifolds; see § Generalizations.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone>Telephone</a> </h2>
<p>A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly. 　A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. 　The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice. 　A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use early in the telephone's history. 　In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device. 　This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households. 　The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice at a distant location. 　The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. 　The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telecommunication system to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker. 　Telephones permit transmission in both directions simultaneously. 　Most telephones also contain an alerting feature, such as a ringer or a visual indicator, to announce an incoming telephone call. 　Telephone calls are initiated most commonly with a keypad or dial, affixed to the telephone, to enter a telephone number, which is the address of the call recipient's telephone in the telecommunication system, but other methods existed in the early history of the telephone. 　The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location. 　Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards. 　These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network. 　For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century. 　Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973. 　In later decades, their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost. 　Convergence in communication services has provided a broad spectrum of capabilities in cell phones, including mobile computing, giving rise to the smartphone, the dominant type of telephone in the world today.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum>Vacuum</a> </h2>
<p>A vacuum is a space devoid of matter. 　The word is derived from the Latin adjective vacuus for "vacant" or "void". 　An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. 　Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. 　In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is considerably lower than atmospheric pressure. 　The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object that is surrounded by a vacuum. 　The quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. 　Other things equal, lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum. 　For example, a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 20%. 　But higher-quality vacuums are possible. 　Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10−12) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm3. 　Outer space is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average in intergalactic space. 　Vacuum has been a frequent topic of philosophical debate since ancient Greek times, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. 　Evangelista Torricelli produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure. 　A Torricellian vacuum is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container closed at one end, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury (see below). 　Vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of incandescent light bulbs and vacuum tubes, and a wide array of vacuum technologies has since become available. 　The development of human spaceflight has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on life forms in general.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luck>Luck</a> </h2>
<p>Luck is the phenomenon and belief that defines the experience of improbable events, especially improbably positive or negative ones. 　The naturalistic interpretation is that positive and negative events may happen at any time, both due to random and non-random natural and artificial processes, and that even improbable events can happen by random chance. 　In this view, the epithet "lucky" or "unlucky" is a descriptive label that refers to an event's positivity, negativity, or improbability. 　Supernatural interpretations of luck consider it to be an attribute of a person or object, or the result of a favorable or unfavorable view of a deity upon a person. 　These interpretations often prescribe how luckiness or unluckiness can be obtained, such as by carrying a lucky charm or offering sacrifices or prayers to a deity. 　Saying someone is "born lucky" may hold different meanings, depending on the interpretation: it could simply mean that they have been born into a good family or circumstance; or that they habitually experience improbably positive events, due to some inherent property, or due to the lifelong favor of a god or goddess in a monotheistic or polytheistic religion. 　Many superstitions are related to luck, though these are often specific to a given culture or set of related cultures, and sometimes contradictory. 　For example, lucky symbols include the number 7 in Christian-influenced cultures, the number 8 in Chinese-influenced cultures. 　Unlucky symbols and events include entering and leaving a house by different doors or breaking a mirror in Greek culture, throwing rocks into the wind in Navajo culture, and ravens in Western culture. 　Some of these associations may derive from related facts or desires. 　For example, in Western culture opening an umbrella indoors might be considered unlucky partly because it could poke someone in the eye, whereas shaking hands with a chimney sweep might be considered lucky partly because it is a kind but unpleasant thing to do given the dirty nature of their work. 　In Chinese and Japanese culture, the association of the number 4 as a homophone with the word for death may explain why it is considered unlucky. 　Extremely complicated and sometimes contradictory systems for prescribing auspicious and inauspicious times and arrangements of things have been devised, for example feng shui in Chinese culture and systems of astrology in various cultures around the world. 　Many polytheistic religions have specific gods or goddesses that are associated with luck, both good and bad, including Fortuna and Felicitas in the Ancient Roman religion (the former related to the words "fortunate" and "unfortunate" in English), Dedun in Nubian religion, the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese mythology, mythical American serviceman John Frum in Polynesian cargo cults, and the inauspicious Alakshmi in Hinduism.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation>Animation</a> </h2>
<p>Animation is a method by which still figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. 　In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. 　Today, many animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). 　Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. 　Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures. 　A cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film, featuring an exaggerated visual style. 　The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of human protagonists. 　Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds), the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that would be lethal in real life. 　The illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement, but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain. 　The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable interruptions, is a stroboscopic effect. 　While animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment. 　Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. 　Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. 　For display on computers, technology such as the animated GIF and Flash animation were developed. 　In addition to short films, feature films, television series, animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in video games, motion graphics, user interfaces, and visual effects. 　The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance, moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation. 　The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata. 　Electronic automata were popularized by Disney as animatronics.</p>

<p>An explosion is a rapid expansion in volume associated with an extreme outward release of energy, usually with the generation of high temperatures and release of high-pressure gases. 　Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel through shock waves. 　Subsonic explosions are created by low explosives through a slower combustion process known as deflagration.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine>Submarine</a> </h2>
<p>A submarine (or sub) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. 　It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability.　[citation needed] The term is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub. 　Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size. 　Although experimental submarines had been built earlier, submarine design took off during the 19th century, and they were adopted by several navies. 　They were first widely used during World War I (1914–1918), and are now used in many navies, large and small. 　Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military) or other submarines, and for aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, nuclear deterrence, reconnaissance, conventional land attack (for example, using a cruise missile), and covert insertion of special forces. 　Civilian uses include marine science, salvage, exploration, and facility inspection and maintenance. 　Submarines can also be modified for specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions and undersea cable repair. 　They are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology. 　Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the bathyscaphe, which evolved from the diving bell. 　Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, that houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes. 　In modern submarines, this structure is the "sail" in American usage and "fin" in European usage. 　A "conning tower" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. 　There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. 　Smaller, deep-diving, and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional design. 　Submarines dive and resurface by means of diving planes and changing the amount of water and air in ballast tanks to affect their buoyancy. 　Submarines encompass a wide range of types and capabilities. 　They include small autonomous examples using A-Navigation and one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours, to vessels that can remain submerged for six months—such as the Russian Typhoon class, the biggest submarines ever built. 　Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human divers.</p>
